1
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,557
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,319
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,873
This is madness.

4
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,913
We're doomed.

5
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,356
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,953
What's that?

7
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,475
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,709
At last.
Where have you been?

9
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,798
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,230
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,237
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

12
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,233
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,871
<i>Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?</i>

14
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,673
What have you done
with those plans?

15
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,677
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,428
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,917
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,636
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,513
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,993
There's one.
Set for stun.

21
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,078
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,997
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,915
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,871
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,268
<i>Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.</i>

26
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,958
Come out,
before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,350
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,914
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,316
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,351
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life forms.

31
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,708
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,991
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,157
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,715
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,115
The Imperial Senate will not
sit still for this.

36
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,357
- You've attacked a diplomatic-
- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

37
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,277
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

38
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,313
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

39
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,159
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

40
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,191
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

41
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,153
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

42
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,999
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

43
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,951
Take her away!

44
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,469
Holding her is dangerous.
If word gets out...

45
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,034
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.

46
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,390
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

47
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,080
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

48
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,997
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

49
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,678
Leave that to me.

50
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,110
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

51
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,198
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

52
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,673
and no transmissions were made.

53
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,793
An escape pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

54
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,753
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

55
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,270
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

56
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,356
There'll be no one
to stop us this time.

57
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,913
Yes, sir.

58
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,876
How did we get into this mess?

59
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,230
I really don't know how.

60
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,032
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

61
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,996
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

62
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,671
What a desolate place this is.

63
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,717
Where do you think you're going?

64
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,276
Well, I'm not going that way.
It's much too rocky.

65
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,757
This way is much easier.

66
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,155
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

67
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,472
Don't get technical with me.

68
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,711
What mission?
What are you talking about?

69
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,949
I've just about had enough of you.

70
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,908
Go that way.

71
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,838
<i>You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.</i>

72
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,994
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

73
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,156
because you won't get it.

74
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,392
No more adventures.

75
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,397
I'm not going that way.

76
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,758
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

77
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,870
He tricked me
into going this way...

78
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,797
but he'll do no better.

79
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,951
Wait. What's that?

80
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,674
A transport. I'm saved.

81
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,438
Over here!

82
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,595
Hey!

83
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,039
Hey!

84
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,436
Help! Please help!

85
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,236
R2?

86
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,750
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

87
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,037
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

88
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,871
Look, sir. Droids.

89
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,199
We stopped.

90
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,958
Wake up. Wake up!

91
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,193
We're doomed.

92
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,116
Do you think
they'll melt us down?

93
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,351
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

94
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,596
Will this never end?

95
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,034
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

96
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,559
Luke!

97
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,715
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets
a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.

98
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,195
Doesn't look like we have
much choice, but I'll remind him.

99
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,990
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

100
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,951
No, not that one.

101
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,512
I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

102
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,428
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs-

103
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,711
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

104
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,434
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed-

105
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,394
I need a droid who understands the
binary language of moisture vaporators.

106
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,637
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

107
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,799
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

108
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,276
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. It's like a second language.

109
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,960
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

110
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,400
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

111
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,318
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

112
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,318
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

113
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,317
Now come on.
Get to it.

114
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,475
All right. Come on.

115
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,190
And the red one.
Come on.

116
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,589
Come on, red. Let's go.

117
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,716
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

118
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,434
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

119
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,835
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?

120
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,470
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

121
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,397
Uncle Owen,
what about that one?

122
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,988
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

123
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,959
- Take this away.
- You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

124
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,877
He really is in first-class condition.

125
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,877
I've worked with him before.
Here he comes.

126
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,359
Let's go.

127
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,038
Don't you forget this.

128
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,470
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

129
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,832
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

130
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,710
I've got such a bad case of dust
contamination I can barely move.

131
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,717
It just isn't fair.

132
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,115
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

133
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,597
Is there anything
I might do to help?

134
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,757
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

135
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,438
or teleport me off this rock.

136
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,039
I don't think so, sir.

137
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,596
I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things.

138
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,948
Not on this planet, anyway.

139
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,311
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

140
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,670
Well, if there's a bright centre
to the universe...

141
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,677
<i>you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.</i>

142
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,631
I see, sir.

143
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,595
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

144
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,353
Just Luke.

145
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,032
And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

146
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,674
This is my counterpart, R2-D2.

147
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,199
Hello.

148
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,676
A lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you've seen a lot of action.

149
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,156
With all we've been through, I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

150
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,838
with the rebellion and all.

151
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,791
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

152
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,151
That's how we came to be in your
service, if you take my meaning, sir.

153
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,475
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

154
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,397
There's not much to tell.

155
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,910
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

156
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,429
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

157
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,957
Well, my little friend...

158
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,275
<i>you got something jammed
in here real good.</i>

159
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,277
Were you on a Starcruiser or-

160
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,312
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

161
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,953
What's this?

162
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,038
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

163
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,914
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

164
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,949
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

165
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,759
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

166
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,598
Old data. Pay it no mind.

167
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,676
Who is she?
She's beautiful.

168
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,997
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

169
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,156
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

170
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,157
A person of some importance,
I believe.

171
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,555
- Our captain was-
- Is there any more to this recording?

172
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,671
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

173
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,439
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

174
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,118
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

175
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,875
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts...

176
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,672
and it's a private message for him.

177
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,711
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

178
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,717
Our last master
was Captain Antilles.

179
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,277
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

180
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,392
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

181
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,034
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you
know what he's talking about?

182
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,469
I don't know anyone
named Obi-Wan...

183
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,316
but old Ben lives
out beyond the Dune Sea.

184
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,112
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

185
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,117
I wonder who she is.

186
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,596
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

187
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,751
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

188
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,553
He suggests that
if you remove the bolt...

189
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,274
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

190
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,391
Oh, yeah. Well...

191
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,830
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

192
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,075
Okay.

193
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,393
There you go.

194
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,878
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

195
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,118
"What message"?

196
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,071
The one you've just been playing.

197
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,156
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

198
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,918
Luke! Luke!

199
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,429
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

200
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,233
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

201
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,591
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

202
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,913
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

203
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,270
No, I don't think
he likes you at all.

204
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,630
No, I don't like you either.

205
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,709
- That R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?

206
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,638
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

207
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,069
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

208
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,756
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

209
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,870
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

210
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,672
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

211
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,590
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to
Anchorhead and have its memory erased.

212
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,551
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

213
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,754
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

214
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,869
He won't.

215
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,676
I don't think he exists any more. He died
about the same time as your father.

216
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,712
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

217
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,713
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

218
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,597
In the morning, I want them on the
south ridge working on those condensers.

219
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,679
Yes, sir.

220
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,360
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

221
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,677
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement-

222
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,870
about me staying on
another season.

223
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,917
If these new droids work out, I want
to apply to the academy this year.

224
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,677
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

225
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,518
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

226
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,551
Harvest is when I need you the most.

227
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,591
It's only one season more.

228
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,712
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

229
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,035
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

230
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,831
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

231
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,713
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

232
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,796
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

233
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,275
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

234
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,072
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

235
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,397
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

236
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,431
It means so much to him.

237
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,395
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

238
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,789
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

239
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,195
That's what I'm afraid of.

240
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,192
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

241
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,992
Please don't deactivate me.

242
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,634
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

243
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,797
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

244
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,230
That R2 unit
has always been a problem.

245
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,828
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

246
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,076
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

247
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,555
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

248
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,357
- Blast it.
- Couldn't we go after him?

249
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,517
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople
around. We'll have to wait till morning.

250
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,517
Luke, I'm shutting
the power down.

251
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,471
I'll be there in a few minutes.

252
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,991
Boy, am I gonna get it.

253
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,468
- That droid's gonna cause me trouble.
- He excels at that, sir.

254
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,999
Come on.

255
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,077
Have you seen Luke this morning?

256
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,431
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

257
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,472
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

258
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,833
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

259
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,518
or there'll be hell to pay.

260
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,954
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

261
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,913
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

262
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,391
Where do you think you're going?

263
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,117
Master Luke is your
rightful owner now.

264
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,073
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

265
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,798
Don't talk to me of your mission.

266
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,912
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

267
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,349
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

268
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,191
What's wrong with him now?

269
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,993
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

270
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,031
Sandpeople. Or worse.

271
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,311
Come on.
Let's go have a look.

272
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,839
Come on.

273
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,708
There are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any-

274
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,512
Wait a second.

275
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,313
They're Sandpeople all right.
I can see one of them now.

276
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,075
Hello there.

277
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,517
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

278
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,752
Don't worry.
He'll be all right.

279
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,149
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

280
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,798
You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

281
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,030
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

282
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,037
Boy, am I glad to see you.

283
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,038
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be travelled lightly.

284
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,470
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

285
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,719
This little droid.

286
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,199
He's searching
for his former master...

287
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,311
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid.

288
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,272
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

289
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,233
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

290
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,913
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

291
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,679
Obi-Wan.

292
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,388
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

293
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,832
A long time.

294
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,793
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

295
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,512
He's not dead.

296
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,755
Not yet.

297
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,713
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

298
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,114
He's me.

299
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,832
I haven't gone
by the name of Obi-Wan...

300
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,474
since, oh, before you were born.

301
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,113
Then the droid does belong to you.

302
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,754
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

303
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,959
Very interesting.

304
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,757
I think we better get indoors.

305
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,000
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

306
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,759
but they'll soon be back-
and in greater numbers.

307
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,795
3PO.

308
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,394
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

309
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,912
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

310
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,634
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

311
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,594
<i>There's no sense in you risking
yourself on my account. I'm done for.</i>

312
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,437
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?

313
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,357
Quickly. They're on the move.

314
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,677
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

315
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,349
That's what your uncle told you. He
didn't hold with your father's ideals.

316
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,438
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

317
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,355
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

318
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,950
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

319
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,078
I wish I'd known him.

320
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,794
He was the best
starpilot in the galaxy...

321
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,477
and a cunning warrior.

322
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,989
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

323
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,435
And he was a good friend.

324
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,913
Which reminds me...

325
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,997
I have something here for you.

326
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,428
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

327
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,074
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

328
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,951
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...

329
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,356
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

330
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,278
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

331
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,879
Go ahead.

332
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,711
- What is it?
- It's your father's lightsabre.

333
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,949
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

334
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,753
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

335
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,876
An elegant weapon...

336
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,833
for a more civilized age.

337
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,636
For over a thousand generations...

338
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,799
the Jedi knights were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

339
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,514
before the dark times...

340
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,232
before the Empire.

341
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,957
How did my father die?

342
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,789
Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader...

343
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,309
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

344
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,271
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

345
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,315
He betrayed and murdered your father.

346
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,190
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

347
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,989
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

348
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,553
The Force?

349
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,189
The Force is
what gives a Jedi his power.

350
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,917
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

351
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,156
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

352
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,872
It binds the galaxy together.

353
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,114
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, little friend...

354
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,316
and where you come from.

355
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,432
- I saw part of a message-
- I seem to have found it.

356
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,678
<i>General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

357
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,076
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

358
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,158
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.</i>

359
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,111
<i>But my ship
has fallen under attack...</i>

360
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,310
<i>and my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

361
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,557
<i>I have placed information vital
to the survival of the rebellion...</i>

362
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,636
<i>into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.</i>

363
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,478
<i>My father will know
how to retrieve it.</i>

364
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,272
<i>You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

365
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,395
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

366
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,432
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

367
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,719
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

368
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,193
Alderaan?

369
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,151
I'm not going to Alderaan.

370
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,396
I've gotta get home.
I'm in for it as it is.

371
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,829
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

372
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,918
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

373
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,551
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.

374
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,118
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

375
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,754
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

376
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,470
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

377
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,275
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

378
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,709
Learn about the Force, Luke.

379
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,990
I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

380
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,877
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

381
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,953
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

382
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,676
Until this battle station is fully
operational, we are vulnerable.

383
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,836
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

384
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,757
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

385
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,633
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander...

386
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,352
not to this battle station.

387
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,916
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate-

388
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,555
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

389
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,233
I've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

390
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,830
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

391
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,839
That's impossible.

392
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,110
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

393
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,552
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

394
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,750
Fear will keep
the local systems in line.

395
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,077
- Fear of this battle station.
- And what of the rebellion?

396
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,272
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

397
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,231
it is possible,
however unlikely...

398
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,351
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

399
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,510
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

400
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,713
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

401
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,717
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

402
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,276
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

403
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,598
I suggest we use it.

404
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,759
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

405
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,111
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

406
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,958
next to the power of the Force.

407
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,356
<i>Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.</i>

408
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,994
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

409
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,759
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

410
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,759
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress-

411
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,351
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

412
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,880
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

413
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,353
As you wish.

414
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,476
This bickering is pointless.

415
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,155
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

416
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,236
by the time this station
is operational.

417
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,912
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

418
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,672
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

419
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,314
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

420
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,591
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

421
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,517
These tracks are side-by-side.

422
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,599
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

423
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,439
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

424
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,553
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

425
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,949
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

426
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,435
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

427
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,553
If they traced the robots here, they may
have learned who they sold them to...

428
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,557
and that would lead
them back... home.

429
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,874
Wait, Luke.

430
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,877
It's too dangerous.

431
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,314
Uncle Owen.

432
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,714
Aunt Beru.

433
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,033
Now, Your Highness,
we will discuss the location...

434
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,594
of your hidden rebel base.

435
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,075
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

436
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,717
You'd have been killed too...

437
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,400
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

438
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,037
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

439
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,677
There's nothing for me here now.

440
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,633
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

441
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,955
Mos Eisley spaceport.

442
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,631
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

443
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,437
We must be cautious.

444
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,477
How long have you
had these droids?

445
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,592
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

446
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,472
Let me see your identification.

447
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,751
You don't need to see
his identification.

448
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,110
We don't need to see
his identification.

449
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,629
<i>These aren't the droids
you're looking for.</i>

450
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,591
These aren't the droids
we're looking for.

451
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,990
He can go about his business.

452
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,192
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

453
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,469
Move along.

454
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,432
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

455
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,271
Go on, go on.

456
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,672
I can't understand how we got by
those troops. I thought we were dead.

457
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,918
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

458
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,992
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

459
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,918
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

460
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,669
Only watch your step-
this place can be a little rough.

461
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,836
I'm ready for anything.

462
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,997
Come along, R2.

463
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,310
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

464
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,238
Your droids- they'll have to wait
outside. We don't want them here.

465
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,669
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

466
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,677
I heartily agree with you, sir.

467
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,837
I'll have one of those.

468
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,720
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

469
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,036
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

470
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,517
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

471
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,313
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead.

472
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,271
This little one's
not worth the effort.

473
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,317
Come, let me get you something.

474
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,957
I'm all right.

475
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,119
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

476
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,791
I don't like the look of this.

477
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,430
<i>Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.</i>

478
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,597
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

479
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,915
Yes, indeed,
if it's a fast ship.

480
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,635
<i>Fast ship? You've never heard of
the Millennium Falcon?</i>

481
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,273
Should I have?

482
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,392
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

483
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,510
I've outrun imperial starships.

484
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,517
Not the local bulk cruisers,
mind you.

485
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,676
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

486
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,351
She's fast enough for you,
old man.

487
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,153
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers-

488
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,953
myself, the boy, two droids...

489
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,877
and no questions asked.

490
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,872
Is it some kind of local trouble?

491
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,915
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

492
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,954
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

493
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,911
And it's gonna cost you
something extra.

494
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,318
10,000, all in advance.

495
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,234
10,000?

496
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,954
We could almost
buy our own ship for that.

497
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,196
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

498
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,276
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot.

499
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,675
We don't have
to sit here and listen-

500
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,519
We can pay you 2,000 now...

501
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,757
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

502
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,589
Seventeen?

503
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,350
Okay, you guys
got yourselves a ship.

504
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,835
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

505
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,029
Ninety-four.

506
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,910
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

507
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,391
All right. We'll check it out.

508
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,116
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

509
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,516
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

510
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,511
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

511
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,551
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

512
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,995
Going somewhere, Solo?

513
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,032
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

514
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,196
Tell Jabba that
I've got his money.

515
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,117
It's too late.

516
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,515
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

517
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,916
Jabba's put a price on your head
so large...

518
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,838
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

519
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,837
I'm lucky I found you first.

520
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,030
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.

521
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,550
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

522
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,831
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba-

523
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,315
Jabba's through with you.

524
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,829
He has no time for smugglers...

525
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,474
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

526
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,149
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

527
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,193
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

528
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,390
Over my dead body.

529
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,589
That's the idea.

530
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,508
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

531
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,868
I'll bet you have.

532
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,876
Sorry about the mess.

533
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,278
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

534
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,676
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

535
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,190
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

536
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,390
What course shall we set?

537
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,751
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

538
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,393
What do you mean?

539
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,318
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

540
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,795
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

541
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,871
Lock the door, R2.

542
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,797
Check this side of the street.

543
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,274
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

544
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,473
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.

545
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,516
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

546
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,753
Watch your language.

547
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,149
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

548
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,390
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

549
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,192
It'll be enough.

550
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,992
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

551
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,157
Right here,Jabba.

552
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,793
I've been waitin' for you.

553
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,751
Have you now.

554
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,596
You didn't think I was
gonna run, did you?

555
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,512
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

556
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,596
Why haven't you paid me...

557
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,951
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

558
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,153
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come yourself. Don't send these twerps.

559
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,636
Han, I can't make exceptions.

560
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,479
What if everyone
who smuggled for me...

561
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,034
dropped their cargo
at the first sign...

562
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,674
of an imperial starship?

563
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,597
It's not good business.

564
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,951
Look,Jabba,
even I get boarded sometimes.

565
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,509
You think I had a choice?

566
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,312
But I got a nice, easy charter.

567
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,319
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

568
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,753
Han, my boy, you're the best.

569
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,110
So, for an extra 20o%-

570
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,117
Fifteen,Jabba.
Don't push it.

571
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,196
Okay, 15o%.

572
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,356
But if you fail me again...

573
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,278
I'll put a price on your head so big...

574
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,393
<i>you won't be able to go near
a civilized system.</i>

575
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,159
Jabba, you're a wonderful
human being.

576
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,669
Come on!

577
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,910
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

578
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,477
What a piece of junk.

579
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,989
She'll make. 5 past light speed.

580
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,759
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

581
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,713
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

582
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,549
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

583
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,399
Hello, sir.

584
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,559
Which way?

585
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,997
All right, men,
load your weapons.

586
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,994
Stop that ship.
Blast them.

587
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,357
Chewie, get us out of here!

588
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,116
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

589
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,118
Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our
passengers are hotter than I thought.

590
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,878
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

591
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,752
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

592
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,913
Stay sharp. There's two more comin'.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

593
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,951
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought this thing was fast.

594
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,832
Watch your mouth, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

595
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,191
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

596
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,072
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.

597
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,951
Here's where the fun begins.

598
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,752
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

599
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,633
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

600
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,239
At the rate they're gaining?

601
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,238
Travelling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

602
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,509
Without precise calculations...

603
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,870
we'd fly right through a star
or bounce too close to a supernova...

604
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,230
and that would end your trip
real quick.

605
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,590
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

606
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,518
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

607
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,875
We've entered
the Alderaan system.

608
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,634
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

609
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,230
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

610
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,637
Charming to the last.

611
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,117
You don't know
how hard I found it...

612
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,037
signing the order
to terminate your life.

613
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,879
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

614
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,992
Princess Leia,
before your execution...

615
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,190
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

616
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,198
that will make
this battle station operational.

617
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,993
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

618
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,671
The more you
tighten your grip, Tarkin...

619
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,314
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

620
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,034
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

621
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,996
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

622
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,156
that'll be destroyed first.

623
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,558
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

624
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,353
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

625
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,357
on your home planet of Alderaan.

626
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,914
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

627
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,235
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

628
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,430
Then name the system.

629
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,517
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

630
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,152
Where is the rebel base?

631
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,113
Dantooine.

632
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,472
They're on Dantooine.

633
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,831
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

634
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,633
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

635
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,796
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

636
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,229
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

637
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,717
<i>But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.</i>

638
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,071
Commence primary ignition.

639
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,556
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

640
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,990
I felt a great disturbance
in the Force...

641
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,112
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

642
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,071
and were suddenly silenced.

643
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,671
I fear something terrible
has happened.

644
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,516
You'd better get on
with your exercises.

645
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,275
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

646
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,277
I told you I'd outrun them.

647
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,076
Don't everybody
thank me at once.

648
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,431
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

649
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,557
Now be careful, R2.

650
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,034
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

651
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,196
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

652
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,550
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

653
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,037
'Cause a droid don't pull people's arms
out of their sockets when they lose.

654
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,230
Wookiees are known to do that.

655
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,672
I see your point, sir.

656
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,236
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

657
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,436
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

658
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,395
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

659
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,317
But it also obeys your commands.

660
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,353
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a blaster at your side.

661
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,389
You don't believe
in the Force, do you?

662
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,795
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

663
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,717
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

664
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,990
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

665
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,271
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

666
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,313
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

667
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,159
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

668
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,033
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

669
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,193
This time, let go your conscious self...

670
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,070
and act on instinct.

671
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,436
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

672
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,835
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

673
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,115
Stretch out with your feelings.

674
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,036
You see? You can do it.

675
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,718
I call it luck.

676
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,308
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

677
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,590
Good against remotes is one thing.

678
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,553
Good against the living,
that's something else.

679
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,471
We're coming up on Alderaan.

680
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,320
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

681
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,638
<i>That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.</i>

682
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,159
Yes?

683
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,111
Our scout ships
have reached Dantooine.

684
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,037
They found the remains
of a rebel base...

685
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,390
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

686
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,717
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

687
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,154
She lied.
She lied to us.

688
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,795
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

689
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,997
Terminate her immediately.

690
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,554
Stand by, Chewie.
Cut in the sublight engines.

691
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,235
What the-

692
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,795
We've come out in a meteor shower,
some kind of asteroid collision.

693
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,115
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

694
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,435
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

695
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,676
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

696
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,518
It ain't there.
It's been blown away.

697
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,200
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

698
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,436
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

699
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,949
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've-

700
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,596
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

701
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,914
It's an imperial fighter.

702
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,388
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

703
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,556
There aren't any bases here.
Where did it come from?

704
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,314
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

705
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,431
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

706
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,757
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

707
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,552
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

708
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,194
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

709
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,039
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

710
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,277
He's heading for that small moon.

711
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,789
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

712
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,311
That's no moon.

713
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,591
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

714
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,149
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

715
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,032
Turn the ship around.

716
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,276
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.

717
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,311
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

718
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,916
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

719
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,711
Why are we still
moving towards it?

720
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,558
A tractor beam's pulling us in.

721
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,238
There's gotta be
something you can do.

722
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,079
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

723
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,475
They're not gonna get me
without a fight.

724
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,236
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

725
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,310
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

726
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,635
<i>We are opening
the magnetic field.</i>

727
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,557
To your stations.
Come with me.

728
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,191
<i>Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.</i>

729
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,716
Yes?

730
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,718
<i>We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.</i>

731
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,515
<i>Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

732
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,235
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

733
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,272
She may yet be of some use to us.

734
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,311
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9.
Release charge.</i>

735
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,396
<i>316, report to control.</i>

736
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,152
There's no one on board, sir.

737
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,874
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

738
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,353
It must be a decoy. Several
escape pods have been jettisoned.

739
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,311
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

740
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,192
If there were any,
they must have jettisoned.

741
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,630
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

742
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:05,909
Yes, sir.

743
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,519
I sense something...

744
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,995
a presence I've not felt since-

745
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,797
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

746
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,357
There's no one here.

747
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,956
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

748
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,992
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

749
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,235
This is ridiculous.

750
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,749
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

751
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,108
Leave that to me.

752
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,152
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.

753
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,556
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

754
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,270
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

755
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,279
Let's go.

756
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,277
Hey, down there.

757
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,757
Could you give us a hand with this?

758
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,149
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

759
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,231
TK-421, do you copy?

760
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,558
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

761
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,955
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

762
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,594
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

763
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,234
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.

764
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,032
We've found
the computer outlet, sir.

765
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,038
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

766
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,116
He's found the controls to the power
beam that's holding the ship here.

767
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,959
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

768
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,119
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

769
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,118
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

770
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,872
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

771
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,231
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

772
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,035
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

773
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,037
They must be delivered safely...

774
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,152
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

775
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,431
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

776
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,751
The Force will be with you...

777
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,233
always.

778
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,510
You said it, Chewie.

779
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,870
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

780
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,473
Ben is a great man.

781
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,353
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

782
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,358
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

783
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,675
Who do you think-

784
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,872
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

785
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,434
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here. "

786
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,028
Who? Who has he found?

787
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,754
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

788
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,472
- Princess?
- Where is she?

789
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,397
Princess? What's going on?

790
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,279
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

791
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,428
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

792
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,393
Oh, no.
We've gotta do something.

793
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,829
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

794
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,757
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

795
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,633
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

796
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,832
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

797
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,269
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

798
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,790
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

799
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,832
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

800
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,633
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

801
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,308
She's rich.

802
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,199
Rich?

803
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,714
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be-

804
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,513
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.

805
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,471
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.

806
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,556
- You'll get it.
- I better.

807
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,079
You will.

808
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,509
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

809
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,517
- All right.
- What's your plan?

810
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,875
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

811
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,719
Okay.

812
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,197
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

813
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,397
<i>Okay, Han,
you put those on.</i>

814
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,789
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

815
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,195
Master Luke, sir,
pardon me for asking...

816
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,392
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

817
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,149
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

818
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,191
That isn't very reassuring.

819
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,676
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

820
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,756
<i>517 to scanner control.</i>

821
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,516
<i>316, report to control.</i>

822
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,156
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

823
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,510
<i>53 to upper bay door.</i>

824
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,670
I can't see a thing
in this helmet.

825
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,400
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

826
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,397
I did say so before.

827
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,832
Where are you
taking this... thing?

828
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,554
Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.

829
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,671
I wasn't notified.

830
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,677
I'll have to clear it.

831
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,189
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

832
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,237
Look out.

833
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,755
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

834
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,950
Here it is- 2187.
You go and get her.

835
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,957
I'll hold them here.

836
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,188
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

837
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,435
<i>What happened?</i>

838
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,357
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

839
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,710
but everything's
perfectly all right now.

840
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,877
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

841
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,560
<i>- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.</i>

842
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,518
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

843
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,349
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

844
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,914
<i>Who is this?
What's your operating number?</i>

845
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:47,590
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

846
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,109
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

847
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,839
Oh, the uniform.

848
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,231
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

849
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,351
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you.

850
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,755
I've got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

851
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,757
- Where is he?
- Come on.

852
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,277
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

853
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,191
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

854
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,995
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

855
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,395
Surely he must be dead by now.

856
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,795
Don't underestimate the Force.

857
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,952
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

858
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,234
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

859
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,149
Yes.

860
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,636
<i>We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

861
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,709
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.

862
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,310
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.

863
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,159
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

864
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,556
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

865
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,953
Get behind me.

866
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,554
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

867
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,273
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.

868
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,914
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

869
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,276
<i>- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?</i>

870
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,710
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

871
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,996
What was that?
I didn't copy.

872
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,396
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

873
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,909
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

874
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,156
All other information on your level
is restricted.

875
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,669
Open up in there.
Open up in there.

876
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,272
Oh, no.

877
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,879
There isn't any other way out.

878
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,396
I can't hold them off forever.
Now what?

879
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,876
Some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

880
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,877
He's the brains, sweetheart.

881
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,592
Well, I didn't-

882
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,070
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

883
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,912
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.

884
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,075
Get in!

885
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,118
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

886
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,475
Get in there,
and don't worry about it.

887
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,879
Wonderful girl.

888
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,997
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

889
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,357
Get in there.

890
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,790
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

891
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,195
<i>What an incredible smell
you've discovered.</i>

892
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,836
Let's get out of here.

893
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,155
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

894
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,950
I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

895
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,230
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

896
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,191
Absolutely, Your Worship.

897
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,515
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

898
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,393
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

899
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,397
It could be worse.

900
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,354
It's worse.

901
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,358
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

902
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,117
Something just moved
past my leg.

903
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,756
Look. Did you see that?

904
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,710
What?

905
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,919
Kid! Luke!

906
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,838
Grab hold of this!

907
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,190
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

908
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,959
- Where?
- Anywhere!

909
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,793
Help him!

910
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,275
- What happened?
- I don't know.

911
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,595
It just let go of me
and disappeared.

912
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,277
I got a bad feeling about this.

913
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,197
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

914
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,273
Help me.

915
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,078
Wait a minute.

916
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,913
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

917
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,593
<i>3PO!</i>

918
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,597
<i>Where could he be?</i>

919
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,756
Take over. See to him.

920
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,559
Look, there.

921
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,150
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

922
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,077
If you hurry, you might catch them.

923
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,599
Follow me.

924
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,077
You stand guard.

925
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,388
Come on.

926
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,517
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

927
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,632
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

928
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,193
All right.

929
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,514
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

930
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,789
3PO.

931
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,639
- Get on top.
- I can't.

932
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,512
Where could he be? 3PO.

933
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,592
3PO, will you come in.

934
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,476
They aren't here.
Something must have happened.

935
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,670
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

936
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,673
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

937
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,070
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

938
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,471
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

939
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,150
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

940
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,077
I forgot.
I turned it off.

941
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,111
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

942
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,554
<i>- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.</i>

943
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,275
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?</i>

944
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,914
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

945
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,828
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!</i>

946
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,599
No, shut them all down.
Hurry! Oh, no.

947
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,039
What?

948
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,877
You did great, 3PO!

949
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,230
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2.

950
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,191
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.

951
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,471
It's all my fault.
My poor master.

952
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,079
We're all right.
You did great!

953
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,675
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance
hatch on unit number- Where are we?

954
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,997
<i>3263827.</i>

955
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,316
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

956
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,192
Let's get moving.

957
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,430
Where you goin'?

958
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,913
Wait! They'll hear!

959
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,717
Come here, you big coward.

960
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,398
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

961
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,874
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

962
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,673
<i>but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?</i>

963
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,313
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

964
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,954
I take orders
from just one person- me.

965
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,517
It's a wonder you're still alive.

966
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,632
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

967
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,910
No reward is worth this.

968
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,557
Give me regular reports, please.

969
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,715
Right.

970
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,912
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

971
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,677
You seen that new VT-16?

972
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,155
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

973
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,077
They say it's quite a thing to see.

974
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,031
What was that?

975
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,277
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

976
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,036
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

977
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,115
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

978
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,037
<i>- Are you safe?
- For the moment.</i>

979
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,355
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

980
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,833
We're right above you.
Stand by.

981
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,554
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

982
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,557
Nice. Come on.

983
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,638
It's them.
Blast them.

984
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,552
Get back to the ship!

985
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,511
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

986
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,110
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

987
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,957
I think we took a wrong turn.

988
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:31,590
There's no lock.

989
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,273
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

990
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,437
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

991
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,232
They're coming through.

992
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,278
Here, hold this.

993
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,953
Here they come.

994
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,313
For luck.

995
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:45,028
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

996
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,190
Where could they be?

997
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,637
Close the blast doors.

998
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,835
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

999
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:38,031
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1000
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,392
The circle is now complete.

1001
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,590
When I left you,
I was but the learner.

1002
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,950
Now I am the master.

1003
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,957
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1004
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,630
Your powers are weak, old man.

1005
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:12,230
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

1006
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,557
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1007
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,637
You should not have come back.

1008
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,879
Didn't we just leave this party?

1009
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,716
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1010
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,229
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1011
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,271
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1012
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,395
Look.

1013
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,877
Come on, R2. We're going.

1014
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,469
Now's our chance. Go!

1015
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,509
Come on!

1016
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:55,953
Come on!

1017
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,992
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1018
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:09,793
<i>Run, Luke, run.</i>

1019
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:16,310
I hope that old man got the tractor beam
down, or this is gonna be a short trip.

1020
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,839
Hit it!

1021
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,917
We're coming up
on their sentry ships.

1022
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,271
Hold them off. Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

1023
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,997
I can't believe he's gone.

1024
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,198
<i>There wasn't anything
you could have done.</i>

1025
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,116
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1026
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,475
You in, kid?
Okay, stay sharp.

1027
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,955
Here they come.

1028
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,032
They're coming in too fast!

1029
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,315
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1030
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,751
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

1031
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,479
Got him. I got him!

1032
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,875
Great, kid.
Don't get cocky.

1033
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,678
There's still two more.

1034
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,629
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1035
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,235
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1036
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,352
Are they away?

1037
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,675
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1038
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:37,591
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1039
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,030
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1040
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,991
This had better work.

1041
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,191
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1042
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,832
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

1043
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,155
That doesn't sound too hard.

1044
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,750
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1045
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,519
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1046
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,312
Not this ship, sister.

1047
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,949
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1048
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,389
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1049
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,590
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1050
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,717
I only hope that when the data's
analysed a weakness can be found.

1051
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,037
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1052
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:18,391
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1053
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,193
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1054
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,390
You needn't worry
about your reward.

1055
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,273
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1056
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,191
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1057
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,357
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

1058
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:36,879
I care.

1059
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,753
So...

1060
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,677
what do you
think of her, Han?

1061
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,552
I'm trying not to, kid.

1062
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,594
Good.

1063
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,633
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1064
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,632
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me-

1065
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,317
No.

1066
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,077
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1067
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,997
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.

1068
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,998
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1069
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,997
It's our only hope.

1070
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,800
<i>- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.</i>

1071
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,115
<i>The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.</i>

1072
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,117
<i>We are preparing
to orbit the planet.</i>

1073
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,751
The battle station
is heavily shielded...

1074
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:39,156
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1075
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:43,759
Its defences are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1076
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:48,874
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defence.

1077
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:54,229
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

1078
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:58,717
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

1079
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,717
or they'd have a tighter defence.

1080
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,632
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1081
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,638
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1082
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,351
The approach will not be easy.

1083
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,472
You're required to manoeuvre
straight down this trench...

1084
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,068
and skim the surface to this point.

1085
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,480
The target area
is only two metres wide.

1086
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,070
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1087
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,357
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1088
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,074
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

1089
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,316
which should destroy the station.

1090
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:35,750
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1091
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,872
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1092
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,036
That's impossible,
even for a computer.

1093
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,755
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1094
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,155
They're not much bigger
than two metres.

1095
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,317
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1096
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,549
<i>Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.</i>

1097
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,875
<i>The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1098
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,468
This will be a day
long remembered.

1099
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,477
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1100
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,068
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1101
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,909
<i>All flight crews,
man your stations.</i>

1102
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,918
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1103
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,917
That's right. Yeah.

1104
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,468
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1105
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:38,479
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1106
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:42,036
Why don't you come with us? You're
pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1107
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,993
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

1108
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,634
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1109
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,399
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1110
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,795
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1111
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,718
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1112
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,559
It's more like... suicide.

1113
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,032
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1114
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,674
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1115
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,028
Hey, Luke.

1116
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,510
May the Force be with you.

1117
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,832
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1118
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,435
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1119
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,190
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

1120
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:41,629
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1121
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,070
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1122
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,429
I only wish Ben were here.

1123
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,116
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1124
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,837
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1125
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,552
Hey, Luke!

1126
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:05,672
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1127
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,756
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1128
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:10,075
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1129
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,517
<i>Are you sure
you can handle this ship?</i>

1130
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,871
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1131
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,989
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1132
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,829
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1133
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:26,520
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1134
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,473
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1135
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:35,033
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1136
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:38,152
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

1137
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,190
You okay, R2?

1138
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,159
Good.

1139
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,794
<i>Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.</i>

1140
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,313
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1141
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,037
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1142
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,273
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1143
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,190
<i>Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.</i>

1144
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:00,278
<i>Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.</i>

1145
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,036
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1146
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,276
<i>- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.</i>

1147
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,994
<i>- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.</i>

1148
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:22,031
<i>- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.</i>

1149
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,957
Red Five standing by.

1150
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,117
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1151
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:33,117
<i>We're passing through
the magnetic field.</i>

1152
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,879
Hold tight.
Switch your deflectors on.

1153
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,353
<i>Double front.</i>

1154
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,952
Look at the size of that thing.

1155
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,548
<i>Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.</i>

1156
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,434
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1157
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,279
<i>- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.</i>

1158
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,676
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1159
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,677
<i>- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.</i>

1160
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,239
This is Red Five.
I'm going in.

1161
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,590
<i>Luke, pull up!</i>

1162
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,436
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1163
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:40,954
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

1164
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,877
We'll have to destroy
them ship to ship.

1165
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,911
Get the crews
to their fighters.

1166
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:48,310
Watch yourself.

1167
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:51,113
<i>There's a lot of fire coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.</i>

1168
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,434
I'm on it.

1169
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,791
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1170
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,632
I've got a problem here.

1171
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,079
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1172
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,270
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right-

1173
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:14,118
<i>The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.</i>

1174
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,400
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1175
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,433
Squad leaders...

1176
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,516
we've picked up
a new group of signals.

1177
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,437
Enemy fighters
coming your way.

1178
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:35,152
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.

1179
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,350
<i>- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.</i>

1180
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,112
You've got one on your tail.

1181
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,076
I'm hit!

1182
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,909
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1183
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,472
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him.

1184
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,116
I'll be right there.

1185
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:14,037
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1186
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,358
<i>- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.</i>

1187
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,675
<i>Fighters above you, coming in.</i>

1188
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:31,359
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1189
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,471
<i>Hang on back there.</i>

1190
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,114
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1191
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,515
<i>There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?</i>

1192
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:39,959
I can't shake him.

1193
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,313
I'm on him, Luke.

1194
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:49,953
Blast it, Biggs.
Where are you?

1195
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:59,359
<i>- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1196
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:02,438
<i>Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.</i>

1197
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,470
<i>I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.</i>

1198
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,990
Stay in attack formation.

1199
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,839
<i>The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.</i>

1200
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:22,472
<i>Switch all power
to front deflector screen.</i>

1201
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:25,672
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1202
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,838
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1203
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,032
<i>Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.</i>

1204
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,833
<i>Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.</i>

1205
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,798
Switch to targeting computer.

1206
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,077
Computer's locked.
Getting a signal.

1207
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,391
The guns. They've stopped.

1208
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,469
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1209
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,909
<i>They're coming in.
Three marks at 210.</i>

1210
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,916
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.

1211
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:03,234
Yes, sir.

1212
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,509
- It's no good. I can't manoeuvre.
- Stay on target.

1213
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,392
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1214
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:24,036
Loosen up!

1215
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,679
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1216
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,030
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1217
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:40,628
We've analysed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1218
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,557
Should I have your ship
standing by?

1219
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,433
Evacuate?
In our moment of triumph?

1220
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:47,869
I think you overestimate
their chances.

1221
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,477
<i>Rebel base,
three minutes and closing.</i>

1222
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,958
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1223
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,718
<i>Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.</i>

1224
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:58,310
<i>- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.</i>

1225
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,158
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1226
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,794
<i>Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.</i>

1227
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,388
<i>Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.</i>

1228
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,717
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1229
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:17,955
This is it.

1230
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:24,396
We should be able
to see it by now.

1231
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,638
Keep your eyes open
for those fighters.

1232
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,675
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1233
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,633
- No sign of any- Wait. Coming in. 35.
- I see them.

1234
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,195
I'm in range.

1235
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:40,078
Target's coming up.

1236
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,551
Just hold them off
for a few seconds.

1237
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:46,879
Close up formation.

1238
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:50,310
Almost there.

1239
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,157
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1240
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,038
I can't hold them.

1241
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:13,631
It's away!

1242
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,513
<i>- It's a hit!
- Negative.</i>

1243
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:21,596
Negative. It didn't go in.

1244
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:24,234
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1245
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,038
<i>Red Leader, we're right above you.</i>

1246
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:34,230
Turn to. 05.
We'll cover for you.

1247
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:37,113
<i>Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.</i>

1248
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,070
<i>Get set up for your attack run.</i>

1249
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,314
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1250
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,559
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.</i>

1251
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:00,877
<i>We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.</i>

1252
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:02,991
Right with you, boss.

1253
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,270
Luke, at that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1254
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,277
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1255
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:16,476
We'll stay back
far enough to cover you.

1256
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,034
<i>My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.</i>

1257
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:20,559
Are you sure
the computer can hit it?

1258
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,797
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1259
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,114
What about that tower?

1260
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,515
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1261
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:39,110
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1262
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,632
<i>Fighters coming in. 3.</i>

1263
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,595
<i>- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.</i>

1264
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:03,075
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

1265
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,951
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1266
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,956
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1267
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,520
R2, try and increase the power.

1268
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,869
<i>Hurry up, Luke. Quick.</i>

1269
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,835
Quick.

1270
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:35,029
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1271
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,195
I'm on the leader.

1272
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:40,913
Hang on, R2.

1273
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,194
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1274
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:03,274
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1275
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:06,910
The Force is strong with this one.

1276
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:08,871
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1277
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,598
<i>His computer's off.</i>

1278
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:17,756
<i>You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?</i>

1279
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:20,314
<i>Nothing. I'm all right.</i>

1280
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:33,949
<i>I've lost R2.</i>

1281
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,756
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1282
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:40,075
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1283
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,633
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1284
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,557
You may fire when ready.

1285
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,633
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1286
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,399
I have you now.

1287
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:04,869
What?

1288
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,156
Look out.

1289
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,473
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1290
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:25,308
<i>Stand by.</i>

1291
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,832
<i>Stand by.</i>

1292
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,717
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1293
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:47,358
<i>Remember, the Force
will be with you always.</i>

1294
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,597
I just knew you'd come back.

1295
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,995
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1296
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:17,997
I knew there was
more to you than money.

1297
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:19,874
Oh, no.

1298
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,309
Oh, my.
R2, can you hear me?

1299
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,719
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1300
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:28,912
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1301
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,793
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1302
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,797
He'll be all right.
