1
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,846
This will begin to make things right.

2
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,767
I've traveled too far and seen too much

3
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,812
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

4
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:09,774
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

5
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,152
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

6
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,029
The General's been after this
for a long time.

7
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,906
Oh, the General?

8
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,367
To me, she is royalty.

9
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,369
Well, she certainly is that.

10
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,376
We got company.

11
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,974
You have to hide.

12
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,517
You have to leave.

13
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:47,645
Go.

14
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,346
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

15
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:34,734
<i>Blast that X-wing!</i>

16
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:35,985
<i>Over there! Over there!</i>

17
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:43,117
I see them.

18
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:15,692
You take this.

19
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,735
It's safer with you than it is with me.

20
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,697
You get as far away from here
as you can.

21
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,574
Do you hear me?

22
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,076
I'll come back for you.

23
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,120
It will be all right.

24
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,472
<i>Keep moving!</i>

25
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,975
<i>Stay here.</i>

26
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,251
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

27
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,880
Something far worse
has happened to you.

28
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,674
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

29
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,968
I know where you come from.

30
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,012
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

31
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:12,099
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

32
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,020
<i>And now you're going
to give it to the First Order.</i>

33
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,606
The First Order rose from the dark side.

34
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,690
You did not.

35
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,361
<i>I'll show you the dark side.</i>

36
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,696
You may try.

37
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,784
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

38
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,577
<i>You're so right.</i>

39
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,905
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

40
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:10,950
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

41
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,702
It's just very hard to
understand you with all the...

42
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,412
<i>- Search him.</i>
- ...apparatus.

43
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,334
<i>- Nothing, sir.</i>
<i>- Put him on board.</i>

44
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,968
<i>Sir, the villagers?</i>

45
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,763
<i>Kill them all.</i>

46
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,850
<i>On my command.</i>

47
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,185
<i>Fire.</i>

48
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,271
Please, no!

49
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,551
<i>Nothing here.
Go ahead!</i>

50
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,677
All right.

51
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,761
All right!

52
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,372
<i>FN-218</i>7.

53
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,542
<i>Submit your blaster for inspection.</i>

54
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,460
Yes, Captain.

55
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,714
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

56
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:31,382
I'm sorry, Captain.

57
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,551
<i>Report to my division at once.</i>

58
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,511
What you brought
me today is worth...

59
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,305
hmm...

60
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,350
one quarter portion.

61
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,012
Shh.

62
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,349
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

63
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,643
He has no respect for anyone.

64
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,440
Your antenna's bent.

65
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,242
Where do you come from?

66
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,831
Classified, really?

67
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,207
Me too. Big secret.

68
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,211
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

69
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,172
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

70
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,757
You'll drown in the sand.

71
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,973
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

72
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,186
No!

73
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,204
In the morning, you go.

74
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,127
You're welcome.

75
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,099
<i>I had no idea we had...</i>

76
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,935
<i>the best pilot in
the Resistance on board.</i>

77
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,355
<i>Comfortable?</i>

78
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:02,940
Not really.

79
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,692
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

80
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,905
<i>No one has been able to
get out of you...</i>

81
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,492
<i>what you did with the map.</i>

82
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,328
You might want to rethink
your technique.

83
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,138
<i>Where is it?</i>

84
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,724
The Resistance...

85
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,810
will not be intimidated by you.

86
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,775
<i>Where... is it?</i>

87
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,496
<i>It's in a droid. A BB unit.</i>

88
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,040
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

89
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,792
<i>I leave that to you.</i>

90
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,630
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

91
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,841
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

92
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,384
Classified.

93
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,137
I know all about waiting.

94
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,182
For my family.

95
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,602
They'll be back. One day.

96
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,395
Come on.

97
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,568
<i>These five pieces are worth...</i>

98
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,529
Let me see here... hmm...

99
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,616
one half portion.

100
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,409
Last week they were a half portion each.

101
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,203
What about the droid?

102
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,081
What about him?

103
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,375
I'll pay for him.

104
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,550
Sixty portions.

105
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,563
Actually...

106
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,484
The droid's not for sale.

107
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,820
Come on.

108
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,494
Follow the girl and get that droid.

109
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,791
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

110
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,301
<i>Turn here.</i>

111
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,263
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

112
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,598
<i>If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.</i>

113
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,683
What?

114
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,019
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

115
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,854
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

116
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:48,981
You're with the Resistance?

117
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,024
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

118
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,110
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

119
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,446
Why? Why are you helping me?

120
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,533
Because it's the right thing to do.

121
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,493
You need a pilot.

122
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,953
I need a pilot.

123
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,539
We're gonna do this.

124
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,873
Yeah?

125
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,380
<i>Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

126
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,966
- I am calm.
<i>- I'm talking to myself.</i>

127
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,469
<i>Not yet.</i>

128
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,056
<i>Okay, go. This way.</i>

129
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,398
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

130
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,567
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

131
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,985
Okay, same principle.

132
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,069
Use the toggle on the left...

133
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,821
to switch between missiles,
cannons and mag pulse.

134
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,364
Use the sight on the right to aim.

135
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,575
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

136
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,249
I can fix this.

137
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,088
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

138
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,924
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

139
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,696
Fourteen failed. Eighteen...

140
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:22,866
I got it.

141
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,330
This thing really moves.

142
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,087
We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

143
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,296
or we're not gonna get very far.

144
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,798
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

145
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:38,882
Just stay sharp.

146
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,679
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

147
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:44,805
I got us dead center.

148
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,014
- It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

149
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,191
- Yeah!
- Yes!

150
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,359
Did you see that?

151
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,069
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

152
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,867
Hey, what's your name?

153
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,202
FN-2187.

154
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,495
F... What?

155
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,414
That's the only name they ever gave me.

156
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,999
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

157
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,584
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

158
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,294
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

159
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,046
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

160
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,298
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

161
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,300
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

162
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,306
Sir, they've
taken out our turbolasers.

163
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,475
Use the ventral cannons.

164
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,728
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

165
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,522
<i>General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?</i>

166
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,024
Yes, and he had help...

167
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,484
from one of our own.

168
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,486
We're checking the registers now...

169
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,488
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

170
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,992
<i>The one from the village. FN-218</i>7.

171
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,411
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

172
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:50,954
Fire.

173
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,007
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

174
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,842
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

175
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:04,968
I see him!

176
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,848
Nice shot!

177
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,272
Where are we going?

178
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,523
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

179
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,192
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

180
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,735
We need to get out of this system.

181
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,695
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

182
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,071
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

183
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,365
He's a BB unit, orange and
white. One of a kind.

184
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,492
I don't care what color he is!

185
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,826
No droid can be that important.

186
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,911
This one is, pal!

187
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,662
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

188
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,080
We go back to Jakku, we die.

189
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,875
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

190
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,877
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

191
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:45,050
<i>FN-218</i>7 <i>reported
to my division...</i>

192
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,469
<i>was evaluated,
and sent to reconditioning.</i>

193
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,805
No prior signs of nonconformity?

194
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,807
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

195
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,016
General!

196
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,476
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

197
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,811
Disabled.

198
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,312
They were headed back to Jakku.

199
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,606
The fighter is projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

200
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,358
They were going back for the droid.

201
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,401
Send a squad to the wreckage.

202
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:26,925
Poe!

203
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,553
Poe!

204
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,429
Poe!

205
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,393
Poe! I got you.

206
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:39,563
Poe!

207
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,445
Poe!

208
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,865
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke
was explicit.</i>

209
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,451
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

210
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:18,328
<i>How capable
are your soldiers, General?</i>

211
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,913
I won't have you question my methods.

212
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,040
<i>They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason.</i>

213
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,960
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

214
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,127
My men are exceptionally trained.

215
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,420
Programmed from birth.

216
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,798
<i>Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.</i>

217
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:30,882
<i>Unharmed.</i>

218
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,135
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

219
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,680
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

220
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,265
<i>I want that map.</i>

221
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,725
<i>For your sake...</i>

222
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,060
<i>I suggest you get it.</i>

223
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,818
Water. Water.

224
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:50,944
No water.

225
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,529
Water.

226
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,490
Is there water?

227
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,271
What? Oi, get off him!

228
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:36,740
Hey!

229
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,175
They work for Unkar.

230
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,052
That guy that wanted you.

231
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,762
He must have really wanted you.

232
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,016
Who?

233
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,102
Him?

234
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:28,083
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

235
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,709
Ow!

236
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,086
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

237
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,670
This droid says you stole it.

238
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,298
I've had a pretty messed up
day, all right?

239
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,508
So I'd appreciate it...

240
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,842
if you stop accusing me of...

241
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,386
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

242
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,805
It belongs to his master.

243
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,186
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

244
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,857
He was captured by the First Order.

245
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,568
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

246
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,823
Poe didn't make it.

247
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,830
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

248
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,714
So you're with the Resistance?

249
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:22,679
Obviously.

250
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,139
Yes, I am.

251
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,515
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

252
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,684
I am with the Resistance.

253
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,312
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

254
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,315
Well, this is what we look like.

255
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,943
Some of us. Others look different.

256
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,486
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

257
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,071
He has to get back to your base.

258
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:42,448
Apparently, he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker...

259
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,200
and everyone's after it.

260
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,536
Luke Skywalker?

261
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,580
I thought he was a myth.

262
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,874
What?

263
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,425
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

264
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:02,886
Come on, BB-8!

265
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,724
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

266
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,934
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

267
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,314
BB-8, stay close!

268
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:15,398
This way.

269
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,405
<i>Call in the air strike.</i>

270
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,782
Come on!

271
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,452
They're shooting at both of us.

272
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,454
Yeah. They saw you with me.
You're marked.

273
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:30,997
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

274
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,916
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

275
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,710
Does anyone have
blasters around here?

276
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,337
Are you okay?

277
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,302
Stop taking my hand!

278
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,611
Hey.

279
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:05,949
Are you okay?

280
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:08,952
Yeah.

281
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:10,745
Follow me.

282
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,549
- We can't outrun them!
- We might...

283
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,926
in that quadjumper!

284
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,344
Hey, we need a pilot!

285
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,012
We've got one.

286
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,138
You?

287
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,766
Uh, what about that ship?

288
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,309
That one's garbage!

289
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,275
The garbage will do.

290
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,875
Gunner position is down there!

291
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,755
You ever fly this thing?

292
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,009
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

293
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,176
Great.

294
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:12,598
Whoa.

295
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,809
I can do this. I can do this.

296
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:16,853
I can do this. I can do this.

297
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,042
Hey!

298
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,922
That's mine!

299
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,094
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

300
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,304
- What?
<i>- Stay low!</i>

301
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,597
It confuses their tracking.

302
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,891
BB-8, hold on!

303
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,434
I'm going low!

304
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,287
What are you doing back there?

305
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,580
Are you ever gonna fire back?

306
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,791
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

307
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,584
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

308
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,628
Try sitting in this thing.

309
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,268
We need cover, quick!

310
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,728
We're about to get some!

311
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,021
I hope.

312
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,215
Damn it!

313
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:21,978
Come on, come on!

314
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,066
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

315
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,707
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

316
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,459
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

317
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,840
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

318
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:05,771
Are we really doing this?

319
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:16,532
Oh, no.

320
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,971
Whoo!

321
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:54,862
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

322
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:55,947
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

323
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,323
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

324
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,158
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

325
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,409
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

326
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,827
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

327
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,287
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

328
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,918
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

329
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,921
He's gonna get you home.

330
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,048
We both will.

331
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,013
I don't know your name.

332
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,517
Finn. What's yours?

333
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,103
I'm Rey.

334
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:32,984
Rey...

335
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,903
Help me with this. Quick!

336
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:37,363
Whoa, what's going on?

337
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,792
Sir...

338
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,503
we were unable to acquire
the droid on Jakku.

339
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,132
It escaped capture...

340
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,801
aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

341
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:02,430
<i>The droid...</i>

342
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,140
<i>stole a freighter?</i>

343
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,641
Not exactly, sir.

344
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,310
It had help.

345
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:12,023
We have no confirmation...

346
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:14,525
but we believe FN-2187 may
have helped in the escape.

347
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:33,878
<i>Anything else?</i>

348
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,174
The two were accompanied by a girl.

349
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,348
<i>What girl?</i>

350
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:49,143
It's the motivator.

351
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,728
Grab me a Harris wrench,
check in there.

352
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:51,812
How bad is it?

353
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,564
If we wanna live, not good.

354
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:54,649
They're hunting for us now.

355
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:55,900
We've gotta get out of this system!

356
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,526
BB-8 said the location
of the Resistance base...

357
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:58,736
is "need to know".

358
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,488
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

359
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:01,572
This?

360
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,450
You gotta tell us
where your base is.

361
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:07,161
I don't speak that.

362
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,996
All right, between us...

363
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,539
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

364
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,125
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

365
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:14,960
But you tell us where the base is...

366
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:16,462
I'll get you there first. Deal?

367
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:20,049
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

368
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:22,802
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

369
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,014
Please.

370
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,935
- The Ileenium system?
- Yeah, the Ileenium system.

371
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,687
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

372
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,397
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

373
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:35,648
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

374
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,816
What about you?

375
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,109
I gotta get back to Jakku.

376
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,193
Back to Jak...

377
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,736
Why does everyone
wanna go back to Jakku?

378
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,406
- It's not that one. No. No.
- That place is...

379
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,408
The one I'm pointing to. No.

380
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:46,784
No. No!

381
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,244
If we don't patch it up...

382
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:49,453
the propulsion tank will overflow...

383
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,205
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

384
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,289
- This?
- Yes.

385
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,502
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

386
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,504
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

387
00:38:58,587 --> 00:38:59,880
You got a family?

388
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,090
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

389
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,675
None of your business, that's why.

390
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,470
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

391
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,436
Someone's locked on to us.

392
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,104
All controls are overridden.

393
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,612
Get off! Get off!

394
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,365
See anything?

395
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:28,826
Oh, no.

396
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,085
It's the First Order.

397
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,962
What do we do?
There must be something.

398
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,423
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

399
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:43,507
Can you unfix it?

400
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:50,306
Come on, BB-8.

401
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,933
I got him.

402
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,020
I'm okay.

403
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:58,397
BB-8, get off me!

404
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:02,943
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

405
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:05,571
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

406
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,121
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

407
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:28,636
Chewie...

408
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,970
we're home.

409
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,154
Where are the others?

410
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:48,823
- Where's the pilot?
<i>- I'm the pilot.</i>

411
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,366
You?

412
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,409
<i>No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.</i>

413
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:53,911
<i>You can understand that thing?</i>

414
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,162
And "that thing"
can understand you, too...

415
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:56,288
so watch it.

416
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:58,290
Come on out of there.

417
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,876
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

418
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,546
Jakku? That junkyard?

419
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:04,839
Thank you! Junkyard.

420
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,007
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

421
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,843
Who had it? Ducain?

422
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,761
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

423
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:13,055
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

424
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,474
Who stole it from me!

425
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:16,976
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

426
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,436
just stole back the
<i>Millennium Falcon</i> for good.

427
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:22,439
This is the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>
You're Han Solo?

428
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,609
I used to be.

429
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,736
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

430
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,196
No, the smuggler.

431
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,115
Wasn't he a war hero?

432
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:34,535
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

433
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:35,870
Twelve!

434
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:38,414
Fourteen.

435
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:54,930
Hey!

436
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,434
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

437
00:41:58,517 --> 00:41:59,602
Unkar Plutt did.

438
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,061
I thought it was a mistake,
too. Puts too much...

439
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:03,439
...stress on the hyperdrive.

440
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,941
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

441
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,943
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

442
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:09,737
Wait, no.

443
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,239
- We need your help.
- My help?

444
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:13,866
This droid has to get
to the Resistance base...

445
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,242
as soon as possible.

446
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,329
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

447
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,753
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

448
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:32,843
You knew him.

449
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,308
Yeah. I knew him.

450
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,018
I knew Luke.

451
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,106
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

452
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:47,775
Wait, what?

453
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,361
Did you just say Rathtars?

454
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,112
Hey!

455
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:54,740
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

456
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,493
I'm hauling Rathtars.

457
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,788
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

458
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,331
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

459
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:04,249
What's a Rathtar?

460
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,834
They're big and they're dangerous.

461
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,461
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

462
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,587
- No.
- Good.

463
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,547
I got three of them going to King Prana.

464
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,967
Three? How'd you get them on board?

465
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,760
I used to have a bigger crew.

466
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,265
Get below and stay there
until I say so...

467
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:21,934
and don't even think about
taking the <i>Falcon.</i>

468
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:23,018
What about BB-8?

469
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:24,812
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

470
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,438
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

471
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,482
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

472
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:32,945
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

473
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,322
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

474
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:38,909
Yes, I do. Every time.

475
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:58,178
Han Solo.

476
00:43:58,262 --> 00:43:59,722
You're a dead man.

477
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:02,558
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

478
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:05,436
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

479
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,063
- Can you see them?
- No.

480
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,233
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

481
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:13,569
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

482
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:16,655
How long we known each other?

483
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:17,823
They have blasters.

484
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:18,991
A lot of them.

485
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:22,286
Not long.
We want our money back now.

486
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,371
You think hunting
Rathtars is cheap?

487
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:25,622
I spent that money.

488
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:28,125
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

489
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,544
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

490
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,504
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

491
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,016
Tasu Leech.

492
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,100
Good to see you.

493
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:56,945
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

494
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:58,405
Have I ever not delivered...

495
00:44:58,489 --> 00:44:59,990
- for you before?
- Yeah.

496
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,289
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

497
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,917
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

498
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:13,587
That BB unit.

499
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,507
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

500
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,303
And two fugitives.

501
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:26,308
First I've heard of it.

502
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,315
Wait, wait, wait.

503
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,529
If we close the blast doors
in that corridor...

504
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:39,780
we can trap both gangs!

505
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,323
We'll close the blast doors from here?

506
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,200
Resetting the fuses should do it.

507
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,960
I got a bad feeling about this.

508
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:55,170
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

509
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,131
Wrong fuses.

510
00:45:57,214 --> 00:45:58,382
Kill them!

511
00:45:58,507 --> 00:45:59,716
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

512
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,369
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

513
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:41,592
What do they look like?

514
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:49,558
They look like that.

515
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,645
- This way.
- Are you sure?

516
00:46:55,564 --> 00:46:56,732
No, no, no!

517
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:59,151
Finn!

518
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:01,236
Finn!

519
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:03,405
Rey!

520
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:07,868
Get off! Get off!

521
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,626
- Rey!
- Finn!

522
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:17,920
Finn!

523
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:20,255
<i>Get off me!</i>

524
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:33,435
<i>Rey!</i>

525
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,358
Get off! Get off!

526
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:43,278
Finn!

527
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:46,281
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

528
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,621
I got the door. Cover us!

529
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:01,338
Chewie!

530
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:05,801
You okay?

531
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:07,970
Wow.

532
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,391
Come on! Come on!

533
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:17,145
Han.

534
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:19,481
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

535
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,407
Hey, where are you going?

536
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,158
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

537
00:48:30,242 --> 00:48:32,035
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

538
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,328
I hate that guy.

539
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:35,956
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

540
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,377
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

541
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:42,296
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

542
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:44,631
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

543
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,011
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

544
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:51,096
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

545
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,347
No problem!

546
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:03,525
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

547
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:08,030
- What?
- Compressor.

548
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:17,748
Inform the First Order...

549
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:19,666
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

550
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,752
And it's aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

551
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:35,057
<i>The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...</i>

552
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:40,062
leading them to the last Jedi.

553
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:45,025
If Skywalker returns...

554
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:49,571
the new Jedi will rise.

555
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,282
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

556
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,076
General!

557
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:59,081
Our strategy must now change.

558
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:01,249
The weapon. It is ready.

559
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,627
I believe the time has come to use it.

560
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,045
We shall destroy the government...

561
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:06,546
that supports the Resistance...

562
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,340
the Republic.

563
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,966
Without their friends to protect them...

564
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,635
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

565
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:14,805
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

566
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:16,139
Go.

567
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:18,350
Oversee preparations.

568
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,102
Yes, Supreme Leader.

569
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,442
There has been an awakening.

570
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,904
Have you felt it?

571
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:33,490
<i>Yes.</i>

572
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,493
There's something more.

573
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:42,207
The droid we seek is aboard
the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

574
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:45,877
In the hands of your father...

575
00:50:45,961 --> 00:50:49,798
Han Solo.

576
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:54,803
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

577
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:59,724
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...

578
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,812
have never faced such a test.

579
00:51:04,438 --> 00:51:07,649
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

580
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,610
We shall see.

581
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:15,031
We shall see.

582
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,333
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

583
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:26,710
Coolant's leaking.

584
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,296
Try transferring auxiliary power...

585
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:30,797
...to the secondary tank.

586
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:32,424
I got it.

587
00:51:32,591 --> 00:51:34,217
Chewie, come on!

588
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,429
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

589
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:38,513
Stop moving!

590
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:42,350
Chewie!

591
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:44,186
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

592
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:46,646
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

593
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:49,024
Which is fine!

594
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,609
This hyperdrive blows,
there are gonna be...

595
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,652
pieces of us in three different systems.

596
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,032
What'd you do?

597
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,993
I bypassed the compressor.

598
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:03,330
Huh.

599
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,876
Move, ball.

600
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:12,130
Ah, don't say that.

601
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:13,882
You did great. Just rest.

602
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:15,884
Good job, kid.

603
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:17,344
Thanks.

604
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:19,179
You're welcome.

605
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:25,352
So...

606
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:26,811
fugitives, huh?

607
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,023
The First Order wants the map.

608
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,399
Finn is with the Resistance.

609
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:33,443
I'm just a scavenger.

610
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:36,488
Let's see what you got.

611
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:39,449
Go ahead.

612
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,752
This map's not complete.

613
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,337
It's just a piece.

614
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:55,340
Ever since Luke disappeared...

615
00:52:55,465 --> 00:52:57,467
people have been looking for him.

616
00:52:57,551 --> 00:52:59,052
Why did he leave?

617
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:03,014
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

618
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:04,766
One boy, an apprentice...

619
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,143
turned against him, destroyed it all.

620
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:10,647
Luke felt responsible.

621
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,233
He just walked away from everything.

622
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:15,402
Do you know what happened to him?

623
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:17,946
A lot of rumors. Stories.

624
00:53:19,948 --> 00:53:22,158
People that knew him best...

625
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,037
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

626
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:29,124
The Jedi were real?

627
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,418
I used to wonder about that myself.

628
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:33,712
Thought it was a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.

629
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:37,173
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

630
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,384
the dark side and the light.

631
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,929
Crazy thing is...

632
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:46,766
it's true.

633
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:50,937
The Force. The Jedi.

634
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:54,524
All of it.

635
00:53:57,777 --> 00:53:59,112
It's all true.

636
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,492
No, you rest.

637
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:07,370
You want my help? You're getting it.

638
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:09,497
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

639
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,125
This is our stop.

640
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:31,019
I didn't know there was
this much green...

641
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,395
in the whole galaxy.

642
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:02,425
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

643
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,177
Did you just call me Solo?

644
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,887
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

645
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,055
You should know...

646
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:09,516
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

647
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,935
Which puts a real target on my back.

648
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,645
Are there any conspirators here?

649
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:15,605
Like, First Order sympathizers?

650
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,400
Listen, Big Deal.

651
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:20,402
You got another problem.

652
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,654
Women always figure out the truth.

653
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:25,573
Always.

654
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:32,956
You might need this.

655
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:35,917
I think I can handle myself.

656
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:38,169
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

657
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:39,254
Take it.

658
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,258
You know how to use one of those?

659
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,009
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

660
00:55:45,093 --> 00:55:46,928
Little bit more to it than that.

661
00:55:47,429 --> 00:55:49,097
You got a lot to learn.

662
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:51,766
You got a name?

663
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:53,685
Rey.

664
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:55,395
Rey.

665
00:55:59,274 --> 00:56:01,693
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

666
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:03,737
A second mate. Someone to help out.

667
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,447
Someone who can keep up
with Chewie and me...

668
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,115
appreciates the <i>Falcon.</i>

669
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,033
Are you offering me a job?

670
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,619
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

671
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:13,580
You're offering me a job.

672
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,291
I'm thinking about it.

673
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:21,129
Well?

674
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:28,303
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

675
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,722
Where, Jakku?

676
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:33,099
I've already been away too long.

677
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:37,187
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

678
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:43,818
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

679
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:48,573
Solo, why are we here again?

680
00:56:48,698 --> 00:56:50,200
To get your droid on a clean ship.

681
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:51,284
Clean?

682
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:54,245
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the <i>Falcon?</i>

683
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:56,456
If we can find it on our scanners...

684
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,875
the First Order's not far behind.

685
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,795
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

686
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:03,713
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

687
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:06,090
We can trust her, right?

688
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:07,717
Relax, kid.

689
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:10,512
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

690
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:13,306
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...

691
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:14,766
so let me do the talking.

692
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,601
And whatever you do, don't stare.

693
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,727
At what?

694
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,854
Any of it.

695
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:43,044
Han Solo!

696
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,466
Oh, boy.

697
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:49,759
Hey, Maz.

698
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:55,557
Where's my boyfriend?

699
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:57,684
Chewie's working on the <i>Falcon.</i>

700
00:57:57,767 --> 00:57:58,768
I like that Wookiee.

701
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,521
I assume you need something.

702
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,022
Desperately.

703
00:58:03,106 --> 00:58:04,107
Let's get to it.

704
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,121
<i>Forgive me.</i>

705
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,459
<i>I feel it again.</i>

706
00:59:08,129 --> 00:59:09,672
<i>The pull to the light.</i>

707
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:15,011
<i>Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

708
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,472
<i>Show me again.</i>

709
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,141
<i>The power of the darkness.</i>

710
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,020
<i>And I will let nothing stand in our way.</i>

711
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:26,356
<i>Show me...</i>

712
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:29,859
<i>Grandfather...</i>

713
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,656
<i>and I will finish...</i>

714
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:36,157
<i>what you started.</i>

715
00:59:48,962 --> 00:59:50,380
A map.

716
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:53,132
To Skywalker himself?

717
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:55,969
You are right back
in the mess.

718
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:59,514
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

719
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:01,349
Hmm...

720
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:02,475
No.

721
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:07,855
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

722
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:09,315
Han.

723
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,528
Go home.

724
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:15,488
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

725
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:17,782
Please, we came here for your help.

726
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,034
What fight?

727
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:23,287
The only fight.

728
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:25,540
Against the dark side.

729
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:26,958
Through the ages...

730
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,168
I've seen evil take many forms.

731
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:32,463
The Sith. The Empire.

732
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:35,883
Today, it is the First Order.

733
01:00:36,676 --> 01:00:39,595
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

734
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:41,097
We must face them.

735
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:43,266
Fight them.

736
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,934
All of us.

737
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,145
There is no fight against the First Order.

738
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:48,354
Not one we can win.

739
01:00:49,564 --> 01:00:50,815
Look around.

740
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:53,276
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

741
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:55,611
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

742
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:57,905
What's this?

743
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:00,742
What are you doing?

744
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:06,956
Solo, what is she doing?

745
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:08,833
I don't know. But it ain't good.

746
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,793
If you live long enough...

747
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:14,380
you see the same eyes
in different people.

748
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:19,761
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

749
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,599
You don't know a thing about me.

750
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,936
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

751
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:32,273
You don't know the First Order like I do.

752
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:35,401
They'll slaughter us.

753
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:37,612
We all need to run.

754
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:39,781
Hmm.

755
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,080
You see those two?

756
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:49,415
They'll trade work for transportation...

757
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,958
to the Outer Rim.

758
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:53,252
There, you can disappear.

759
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:54,462
Finn?

760
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:57,882
Come with me.

761
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:00,968
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

762
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:02,720
We have to get him back to your base.

763
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:09,143
I can't.

764
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:19,153
Keep it, kid.

765
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:30,832
Who's the girl?

766
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:37,755
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

767
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:38,923
What are you doing?

768
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:41,676
Don't leave without me.

769
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:47,348
You can't just go. I won't let you.

770
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,516
I'm not who you think I am.

771
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:49,684
Finn, what are you talking about?

772
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:50,810
I'm not Resistance.

773
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:53,020
I'm not a hero.

774
01:02:56,274 --> 01:02:58,025
I'm a stormtrooper.

775
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:02,113
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

776
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:04,866
And raised to do one thing.

777
01:03:05,575 --> 01:03:08,703
But my first battle, I made a choice.

778
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,706
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

779
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:15,293
So I ran. Right into you.

780
01:03:16,878 --> 01:03:18,963
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.

781
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:24,177
I was ashamed of what I was.

782
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,723
But I'm done with the First Order.

783
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:30,641
I'm never going back.

784
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:34,478
Rey, come with me.

785
01:03:35,563 --> 01:03:36,814
Don't go.

786
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:43,738
Take care of yourself.

787
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:47,200
Please.

788
01:04:00,922 --> 01:04:03,007
<i>No!</i>

789
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,259
<i>No!</i>

790
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:21,442
<i>No! Come back!</i>

791
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,237
<i>No!</i>

792
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:42,129
<i>Come back!</i>

793
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:54,308
<i>No!</i>

794
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,111
<i>No!</i>

795
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:48,738
<i>Its energy...</i>

796
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:54,577
- ...<i>surrounds us...</i>
<i>- No!</i>

797
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:57,038
...<i>and binds us...</i>

798
01:06:04,879 --> 01:06:06,005
<i>The Force will be...</i>

799
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:16,557
<i>No!</i>

800
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,559
Come back!

801
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,186
<i>Quiet, girl.</i>

802
01:06:21,062 --> 01:06:22,063
No!

803
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,651
<i>Rey?</i>

804
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:34,950
<i>These are your first steps.</i>

805
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:40,915
What was that?

806
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,877
I shouldn't have gone in there.

807
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:49,590
That lightsaber was Luke's.

808
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:51,467
And his father's before him.

809
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:55,221
And now, it calls to you.

810
01:06:55,346 --> 01:06:56,764
I have to get back to Jakku.

811
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,100
Han told me.

812
01:07:06,857 --> 01:07:08,901
Dear child.

813
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:11,028
I see your eyes.

814
01:07:11,112 --> 01:07:14,115
You already know the truth.

815
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:16,659
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

816
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:19,954
they're never coming back.

817
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:27,128
But...

818
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:29,630
there's someone who still could.

819
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:33,926
Luke.

820
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:37,680
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

821
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:39,473
it is ahead.

822
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:43,144
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

823
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:47,356
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

824
01:07:49,275 --> 01:07:50,860
Close your eyes.

825
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:54,155
Feel it.

826
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,533
The light...

827
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:00,035
it's always been there.

828
01:08:00,161 --> 01:08:02,163
It will guide you.

829
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,333
The saber. Take it.

830
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:12,298
I'm never touching that thing again.

831
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:13,883
I don't want any part of this.

832
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,345
Hmm.

833
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:43,871
<i>Today is the end
of the Republic.</i>

834
01:08:45,873 --> 01:08:51,378
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.</i>

835
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:56,759
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here...</i>

836
01:08:56,884 --> 01:09:01,722
<i>the New Republic lies to the galaxy...</i>

837
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:05,434
<i>while secretly supporting
the treachery...</i>

838
01:09:06,227 --> 01:09:09,563
<i>of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

839
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:13,150
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built...</i>

840
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:15,069
<i>upon which we stand...</i>

841
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:17,571
<i>will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

842
01:09:17,655 --> 01:09:20,491
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

843
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:25,037
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

844
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,623
<i>And will remember this...</i>

845
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:32,795
<i>as the last day of the Republic!</i>

846
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,715
Confirm transfer to manual control.

847
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,342
Configure!

848
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:39,927
<i>Fire!</i>

849
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:42,656
No. What is it?

850
01:10:58,672 --> 01:10:59,840
It was the Republic.

851
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:02,635
The First Order, they've done it.

852
01:11:05,012 --> 01:11:06,180
Where's Rey?

853
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:25,699
What are you doing?

854
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,911
You have to go back.

855
01:11:28,994 --> 01:11:30,120
I'm leaving.

856
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:32,373
BB-8...

857
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:33,540
No, you can't.

858
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:35,793
You have to go back,
you're too important.

859
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,044
They'll help you.

860
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:53,018
I've had this for ages.

861
01:11:57,064 --> 01:11:58,399
Kept it locked away.

862
01:11:58,857 --> 01:11:59,858
Where'd you get that?

863
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:04,238
A good question. For another time.

864
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:06,323
Take it.

865
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:07,908
Find your friend!

866
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:17,084
Those beasts.

867
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:18,210
They're here.

868
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,778
<i>FN-41</i>7<i>, hold position.</i>

869
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,282
Oh, safety.

870
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:15,058
<i>Sir.</i>

871
01:13:15,142 --> 01:13:16,477
<i>The droid was spotted heading west.</i>

872
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,561
<i>With a girl.</i>

873
01:13:23,108 --> 01:13:25,569
You have to keep going.
Stay out of sight.

874
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:28,489
I'll try to fight them off.

875
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:29,823
I hope so, too.

876
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:44,171
Come on, Chewie!

877
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,592
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

878
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:49,676
Now! Go!

879
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,095
I need a weapon!

880
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:53,639
You have one!

881
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:05,692
Hey, can I try that?

882
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:13,659
I like this thing.

883
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:20,916
<i>Traitor!</i>

884
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:07,504
- You okay, Big Deal?
- Thanks.

885
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:08,589
<i>Don't move.</i>

886
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,592
<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody.</i>

887
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:20,017
<i>We have incoming at 28. 6.</i>

888
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,102
<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

889
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:26,106
<i>Scramble all squads, repeat,
scramble all squads!</i>

890
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,941
<i>Head to higher cover and wait
for our position!</i>

891
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:32,279
It's the Resistance.

892
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,372
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

893
01:15:42,456 --> 01:15:44,082
<i>- Copy that.</i>
<i>- We're with you, Poe.</i>

894
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:13,820
Quick!

895
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:44,101
Whoo! Yeah!

896
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:46,603
That's one hell of a pilot!

897
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,021
Whoo-hoo!

898
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,411
<i>The girl I've heard so much about.</i>

899
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:58,258
<i>The droid.</i>

900
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:02,220
<i>Where is it?</i>

901
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:09,061
<i>Request air support.</i>

902
01:18:16,193 --> 01:18:17,569
<i>The map.</i>

903
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:21,698
<i>You've seen it.</i>

904
01:18:21,782 --> 01:18:24,117
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters.</i>

905
01:18:25,077 --> 01:18:26,661
<i>We need more troops.</i>

906
01:18:26,787 --> 01:18:28,622
<i>Pull the division out.</i>

907
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:31,792
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

908
01:18:38,632 --> 01:18:39,925
<i>Pull back to tree line!</i>

909
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:56,858
No!

910
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:01,988
No, no!

911
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,992
No! No!

912
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:08,995
Rey!

913
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:30,016
He took her. Did you see that?

914
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:32,269
He took her. She's gone.

915
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:33,520
Yeah, I know.

916
01:19:42,863 --> 01:19:44,197
Let's go.

917
01:19:57,878 --> 01:20:00,380
Goodness! Han Solo!

918
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:02,674
It is I, C-3PO.

919
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:04,718
You probably don't recognize me...

920
01:20:04,885 --> 01:20:06,344
because of the red arm.

921
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:08,388
Look who it is, did you see who...

922
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:11,183
Uh...

923
01:20:11,725 --> 01:20:12,726
Hmm.

924
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:15,896
Excuse me, Prin... General. Sorry.

925
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:18,315
Come along, BB-8, quickly.

926
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:21,067
Yes, I must get
my proper arm reinstalled.

927
01:20:22,986 --> 01:20:24,738
You changed your hair.

928
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:28,491
Same jacket.

929
01:20:29,743 --> 01:20:31,536
No, new jacket.

930
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:45,508
I saw him.

931
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:49,596
Leia, I saw our son.

932
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:52,557
He was here.

933
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:34,349
Hey!

934
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:40,814
BB-8, my buddy.

935
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:42,899
Oh, it's so good to see you.

936
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:43,984
Finn saved you?

937
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,151
Where is he?

938
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:46,486
Poe?

939
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:49,030
Oh, no.

940
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:51,074
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

941
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:53,326
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

942
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,744
I got thrown from the crash.

943
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:56,746
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

944
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,206
BB-8 says that you saved him.

945
01:21:58,331 --> 01:21:59,833
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

946
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,459
You completed my mission, Finn...

947
01:22:01,543 --> 01:22:02,544
That's my jacket.

948
01:22:02,711 --> 01:22:05,088
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

949
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,923
Keep it. It suits you.

950
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:09,551
You're a good man, Finn.

951
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:12,429
Poe, I need your help.

952
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:16,808
<i>PZ-4CO,
report to communications.</i>

953
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:20,895
General Organa...

954
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:24,858
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

955
01:22:24,983 --> 01:22:27,819
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

956
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,696
That was incredibly brave what you did.

957
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:32,365
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

958
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,367
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

959
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:36,369
Han told me about the girl.

960
01:22:36,453 --> 01:22:37,579
I'm sorry.

961
01:22:37,704 --> 01:22:39,748
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

962
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:40,832
He worked on the base.

963
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,251
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

964
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:44,627
That's where my friend was taken.

965
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:46,004
I've got to get there fast.

966
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:47,589
And I will do everything I can to help...

967
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:49,883
but first you need to tell us
all you know.

968
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:54,596
That sounds very scary.

969
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:58,850
You must be so brave.

970
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:02,687
General...

971
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:04,189
I regret to inform you...

972
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:05,899
but this map recovered from BB-8...

973
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:07,484
is only partially complete.

974
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:11,321
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

975
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:13,531
We simply do not have
enough information...

976
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:15,116
to locate Master Luke.

977
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:18,203
Can't believe I was so foolish
to think I could find Luke...

978
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:19,287
and bring him home.

979
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:20,538
Leia.

980
01:23:20,622 --> 01:23:21,706
Don't do that.

981
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:22,999
Do what?

982
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:24,209
Anything.

983
01:23:25,627 --> 01:23:27,504
Princesses.

984
01:23:27,629 --> 01:23:29,172
I'm trying to be helpful.

985
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,424
When did that ever help?

986
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:33,218
And don't say the Death Star.

987
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:49,442
BB-8.

988
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:52,612
You're wasting your time.

989
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,447
It is very doubtful that R2 would have

990
01:23:54,614 --> 01:23:55,782
the rest of the map in his backup data.

991
01:23:55,949 --> 01:23:58,076
I am afraid not.

992
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:02,205
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

993
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:08,044
Sadly, he may never be
his old self again.

994
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:11,381
Listen to me, will you?

995
01:24:12,382 --> 01:24:14,717
I know every time you...

996
01:24:16,928 --> 01:24:19,305
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

997
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:21,391
You think I want to forget him?

998
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:23,143
I want him back.

999
01:24:23,268 --> 01:24:25,353
There's nothing more we could
have done.

1000
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:28,481
There's too much Vader in him.

1001
01:24:28,565 --> 01:24:31,484
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

1002
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:33,278
I just never should have sent him away.

1003
01:24:33,361 --> 01:24:34,946
That's when I lost him.

1004
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:38,199
That's when I lost you both.

1005
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:42,954
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

1006
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:46,916
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

1007
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,710
We both did.

1008
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,672
We lost our son.

1009
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:53,923
Forever.

1010
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:55,008
No.

1011
01:24:55,133 --> 01:24:56,676
It was Snoke.

1012
01:24:57,135 --> 01:24:59,762
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1013
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:01,431
But we can still save him.

1014
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,266
Me.

1015
01:25:04,184 --> 01:25:05,226
You.

1016
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,396
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1017
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,898
Luke is a Jedi.

1018
01:25:11,483 --> 01:25:12,817
You're his father.

1019
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:19,324
There is still light in him, I know it.

1020
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,117
General...

1021
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:23,703
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

1022
01:25:50,522 --> 01:25:51,523
Where am I?

1023
01:25:53,858 --> 01:25:55,193
<i>You're my guest.</i>

1024
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:56,611
Where are the others?

1025
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,363
<i>Do you mean the murderers...</i>

1026
01:25:58,446 --> 01:26:01,324
<i>traitors, and thieves you call friends?</i>

1027
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:04,744
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

1028
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,831
<i>You still want to kill me.</i>

1029
01:26:09,624 --> 01:26:11,292
That happens
when you're being hunted...

1030
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:13,294
by a creature in a mask.

1031
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:40,071
Tell me about the droid.

1032
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:42,740
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...

1033
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:44,158
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

1034
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:46,369
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

1035
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:47,829
And we have the rest.

1036
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:49,706
Recovered from the archives
of the Empire...

1037
01:26:49,789 --> 01:26:50,873
but we need the last piece.

1038
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:53,418
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

1039
01:26:55,044 --> 01:26:56,045
You.

1040
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:58,756
A scavenger.

1041
01:27:01,092 --> 01:27:03,219
You know I can take whatever I want.

1042
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,269
You're so lonely.

1043
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:14,772
So afraid to leave.

1044
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:21,863
At night, desperate to sleep.

1045
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:26,576
You imagine an ocean.

1046
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:28,828
I see it.

1047
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:31,831
I see the island.

1048
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:37,712
And Han Solo.

1049
01:27:40,048 --> 01:27:42,216
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

1050
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,344
He would have disappointed you.

1051
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:45,762
Get out of my head.

1052
01:27:46,888 --> 01:27:48,431
I know you've seen the map.

1053
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,184
It's in there.

1054
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:53,353
And now you'll give it to me.

1055
01:28:01,986 --> 01:28:04,030
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1056
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:08,993
I'm not giving you anything.

1057
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:10,703
We'll see.

1058
01:28:50,702 --> 01:28:51,703
You.

1059
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:53,788
You're afraid.

1060
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:59,752
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

1061
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:10,763
<i>The scavenger...</i>

1062
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:12,515
resisted you?

1063
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:14,183
She is strong with the Force.

1064
01:29:14,267 --> 01:29:16,060
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1065
01:29:16,144 --> 01:29:17,353
And the droid?

1066
01:29:17,437 --> 01:29:20,773
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

1067
01:29:20,857 --> 01:29:23,484
That the girl was all we needed.

1068
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:26,070
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

1069
01:29:26,154 --> 01:29:27,280
to the hands of the enemy.

1070
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:29,115
They may have the map already.

1071
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:30,825
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed...

1072
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,952
before they get to Skywalker.

1073
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:34,912
We have their location.

1074
01:29:34,996 --> 01:29:37,623
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the Ileenium system.

1075
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:39,917
Good.

1076
01:29:40,001 --> 01:29:42,879
Then we will crush them
once and for all.

1077
01:29:42,962 --> 01:29:44,714
Prepare the weapon.

1078
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:48,134
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1079
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:50,011
I just need your guidance.

1080
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:55,725
If what you say about this girl is true...

1081
01:29:56,350 --> 01:30:01,022
Bring her to me.

1082
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:17,163
You will remove these restraints...

1083
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:20,333
and leave this cell with the door open.

1084
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,838
<i>What did you say?</i>

1085
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:30,259
You will remove these restraints...

1086
01:30:30,343 --> 01:30:33,012
and leave this cell with the door open.

1087
01:30:39,852 --> 01:30:41,395
<i>I'll tighten
those restraints...</i>

1088
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:43,564
<i>scavenger scum.</i>

1089
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,455
You will remove these restraints...

1090
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:01,916
and leave this cell with the door open.

1091
01:31:05,628 --> 01:31:07,213
<i>I will remove
these restraints...</i>

1092
01:31:07,296 --> 01:31:09,048
<i>and leave the cell with the door open.</i>

1093
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:21,018
- And you'll drop your weapon.
<i>- And I'll drop my weapon.</i>

1094
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:34,824
<i>No.</i>

1095
01:31:35,825 --> 01:31:36,826
<i>No.</i>

1096
01:31:38,744 --> 01:31:39,871
<i>Guards!</i>

1097
01:31:42,415 --> 01:31:43,416
<i>Guards!</i>

1098
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,673
Begin charging the weapon.

1099
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:52,091
Yes, sir.

1100
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:53,467
Weapon charging.

1101
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:14,739
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight...

1102
01:32:14,822 --> 01:32:16,157
confirms Finn's report.

1103
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:18,242
They've somehow created
a hyper-lightspeed weapon...

1104
01:32:18,326 --> 01:32:19,619
built within the planet itself.

1105
01:32:19,785 --> 01:32:20,745
A laser cannon?

1106
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:22,663
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

1107
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:23,789
It's another Death Star.

1108
01:32:23,873 --> 01:32:25,625
I wish that were the case, Major.

1109
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:26,959
This was the Death Star.

1110
01:32:29,712 --> 01:32:32,214
And this is Starkiller Base.

1111
01:32:32,715 --> 01:32:33,883
So, it's big.

1112
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:37,053
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1113
01:32:37,178 --> 01:32:39,305
It uses the power of the sun.

1114
01:32:40,514 --> 01:32:41,682
As the weapon is charged...

1115
01:32:41,807 --> 01:32:43,893
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1116
01:32:43,976 --> 01:32:44,977
Ma'am.

1117
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:48,022
The First Order...

1118
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:49,565
they're charging the weapon again now.

1119
01:32:50,524 --> 01:32:52,401
Our system is the next target.

1120
01:32:52,526 --> 01:32:53,527
Oh, my.

1121
01:32:53,611 --> 01:32:55,112
Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.

1122
01:32:55,196 --> 01:32:56,989
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1123
01:32:57,073 --> 01:32:59,408
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1124
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:01,160
In order
for that amount of power...

1125
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:02,620
to be contained...

1126
01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:04,664
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1127
01:33:04,789 --> 01:33:06,958
There is one. Precinct 47.

1128
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:08,793
Here.

1129
01:33:08,876 --> 01:33:10,836
If we can destroy
that oscillator...

1130
01:33:10,962 --> 01:33:13,923
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1131
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:15,800
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

1132
01:33:15,883 --> 01:33:17,218
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1133
01:33:17,343 --> 01:33:18,678
They have defensive shields...

1134
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:20,721
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1135
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:22,264
We disable the shields.

1136
01:33:22,348 --> 01:33:24,016
Kid, you worked there.

1137
01:33:24,141 --> 01:33:25,142
What do you got?

1138
01:33:25,226 --> 01:33:26,435
I can do it.

1139
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:27,770
I like this guy.

1140
01:33:27,895 --> 01:33:29,772
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

1141
01:33:29,855 --> 01:33:31,315
On the planet.

1142
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:33,025
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1143
01:33:33,776 --> 01:33:35,277
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1144
01:33:35,403 --> 01:33:37,279
So we disable the shields...

1145
01:33:37,363 --> 01:33:39,657
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1146
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:41,867
All right. Let's go.

1147
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,891
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1148
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:07,476
Come on. Let's go.

1149
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,770
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1150
01:34:09,895 --> 01:34:10,938
Now you tell me?

1151
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:14,275
You know, no matter
how much we fought...

1152
01:34:15,693 --> 01:34:18,029
I've always hated watching you leave.

1153
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,321
That's why I did it.

1154
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:22,074
So you'd miss me.

1155
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:26,620
I did miss you.

1156
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,874
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1157
01:34:29,957 --> 01:34:31,042
Huh?

1158
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:34,253
Some of it was... good.

1159
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,088
Pretty good.

1160
01:34:39,425 --> 01:34:42,303
- Some things never change.
- True.

1161
01:34:42,845 --> 01:34:44,847
You still drive me crazy.

1162
01:34:54,023 --> 01:34:55,941
If you see our son...

1163
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:00,112
bring him home.

1164
01:35:05,534 --> 01:35:08,204
<i>Sir, sensors
triggered in Hangar</i> 7<i>18.</i>

1165
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:09,955
<i>We're searching the area.</i>

1166
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:12,166
<i>She's just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

1167
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,959
<i>The longer it takes to find her...</i>

1168
01:35:14,043 --> 01:35:15,711
<i>the more dangerous she becomes.</i>

1169
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,426
<i>All sentry droids...</i>

1170
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:23,719
<i>all sentry droids...</i>

1171
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:26,055
<i>resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time.</i>

1172
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:28,140
<i>Offset 4</i>7<i>3.</i>

1173
01:35:30,893 --> 01:35:31,977
How are we getting in?

1174
01:35:32,103 --> 01:35:34,063
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

1175
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:35,815
Keeps anything traveling
slower than lightspeed...

1176
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:37,316
from getting through.

1177
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,985
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1178
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:42,530
Chewie, get ready.

1179
01:35:43,823 --> 01:35:44,990
And... Now!

1180
01:35:48,911 --> 01:35:50,579
I am pulling up!

1181
01:35:57,294 --> 01:35:58,921
I get any higher...

1182
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:00,256
they'll see us!

1183
01:36:22,194 --> 01:36:24,572
Sir, she was
not found in Hangar 718.

1184
01:36:24,697 --> 01:36:25,781
But all troops are on alert.

1185
01:36:25,865 --> 01:36:27,241
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.</i>

1186
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:29,034
<i>She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...</i>

1187
01:36:31,662 --> 01:36:33,205
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1188
01:36:44,425 --> 01:36:46,135
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1189
01:36:46,218 --> 01:36:47,469
We'll get in that way.

1190
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:49,471
What was your job
when you were based here?

1191
01:36:49,555 --> 01:36:50,556
Sanitation.

1192
01:36:53,434 --> 01:36:55,144
Sanitation?

1193
01:36:55,227 --> 01:36:56,937
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1194
01:36:57,062 --> 01:36:58,063
I don't.

1195
01:36:58,189 --> 01:36:59,940
I'm just here to get Rey.

1196
01:37:00,065 --> 01:37:03,652
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1197
01:37:03,736 --> 01:37:05,070
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1198
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,448
We'll use the Force.

1199
01:37:07,573 --> 01:37:09,658
That's not how the Force works.

1200
01:37:11,243 --> 01:37:13,787
Oh, really? You're cold?

1201
01:37:13,954 --> 01:37:14,955
Come on.

1202
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:23,672
Report.

1203
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:25,966
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1204
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:29,428
<i>Hey!</i>

1205
01:37:32,598 --> 01:37:34,808
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

1206
01:37:34,934 --> 01:37:37,436
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1207
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:47,863
- You remember me?
<i>- FN-218</i>7.

1208
01:37:47,947 --> 01:37:49,198
Not anymore.

1209
01:37:49,365 --> 01:37:50,699
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1210
01:37:50,783 --> 01:37:52,826
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1211
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,912
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

1212
01:37:54,995 --> 01:37:56,121
Follow me.

1213
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:10,761
<i>Have you
checked out the new T-1</i>7<i>s?</i>

1214
01:38:10,844 --> 01:38:12,513
<i>The T-1</i>7<i>s,
as far as I can tell...</i>

1215
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:13,681
<i>are a great improvement.</i>

1216
01:38:13,806 --> 01:38:15,641
<i>Yeah.
That's what they tell you.</i>

1217
01:38:15,766 --> 01:38:16,976
<i>But believe me, they don't hold up.</i>

1218
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:18,602
<i>- They don't?
- No.</i>

1219
01:38:54,305 --> 01:38:56,056
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

1220
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,266
Lower the shields.

1221
01:38:57,349 --> 01:38:59,184
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

1222
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,395
Do it.

1223
01:39:05,649 --> 01:39:06,775
Solo, if this works...

1224
01:39:06,859 --> 01:39:09,111
we're not gonna have
a lot of time to find Rey.

1225
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:10,571
Don't worry, kid.

1226
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:12,781
We won't leave here without her.

1227
01:39:14,575 --> 01:39:17,453
<i>You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.</i>

1228
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:20,122
<i>My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.</i>

1229
01:39:20,205 --> 01:39:22,041
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1230
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:24,209
Is there a garbage chute?

1231
01:39:24,877 --> 01:39:26,211
Trash compactor?

1232
01:39:27,379 --> 01:39:28,464
Yeah, there is.

1233
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:30,341
General, their shields are down.

1234
01:39:30,424 --> 01:39:32,009
Thank the Maker!

1235
01:39:32,092 --> 01:39:33,844
Han did it. Send them in.

1236
01:39:33,927 --> 01:39:35,846
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1237
01:39:35,929 --> 01:39:38,223
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

1238
01:39:38,307 --> 01:39:39,308
Roger, base.

1239
01:39:39,391 --> 01:39:41,101
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1240
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:43,312
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1241
01:39:57,076 --> 01:39:58,577
<i>Almost in range.</i>

1242
01:39:58,744 --> 01:40:01,497
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1243
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,457
Approaching target.

1244
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:08,879
Fighters incoming!

1245
01:40:09,755 --> 01:40:11,340
<i>Coming at 28.336.</i>

1246
01:40:11,423 --> 01:40:13,217
Forty-five!
Shields up! Shields up!

1247
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,968
Dispatch all squadrons.

1248
01:40:15,094 --> 01:40:16,595
Yes, General.

1249
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:18,430
All right. Let's light it up.

1250
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:30,275
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

1251
01:40:30,359 --> 01:40:31,610
<i>Yeah, we gotta
keep hitting it.</i>

1252
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:33,070
Another bombing run.

1253
01:40:33,195 --> 01:40:35,906
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

1254
01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:38,575
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1255
01:40:40,285 --> 01:40:41,829
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1256
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,087
<i>We think
they may be splitting up.</i>

1257
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:52,131
<i>Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

1258
01:40:59,972 --> 01:41:01,974
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1259
01:41:02,057 --> 01:41:04,810
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1260
01:41:04,893 --> 01:41:05,978
You sure you're up for this?

1261
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:07,271
Hell, no.

1262
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:08,647
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1263
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:09,940
The troopers will be on our tail.

1264
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:12,151
We have to be ready for that.

1265
01:41:12,234 --> 01:41:14,027
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1266
01:41:14,111 --> 01:41:16,655
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

1267
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:18,073
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1268
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:36,383
You all right?

1269
01:41:36,467 --> 01:41:38,093
- Yeah.
- Good.

1270
01:41:38,177 --> 01:41:39,761
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

1271
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:41,221
Finn, what are you doing here?

1272
01:41:41,346 --> 01:41:43,432
We came back for you.

1273
01:41:44,308 --> 01:41:45,851
What'd he say?

1274
01:41:45,934 --> 01:41:47,311
That it was your idea.

1275
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:52,191
Thank you.

1276
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:57,654
How did you get away?

1277
01:41:57,738 --> 01:41:58,780
I can't explain it.

1278
01:41:58,864 --> 01:42:00,949
And you wouldn't believe it.

1279
01:42:01,033 --> 01:42:03,368
Escape now, hug later.

1280
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,093
I got one behind me.

1281
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:21,595
<i>- You see it?</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1282
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:32,064
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

1283
01:42:36,985 --> 01:42:38,946
They're in trouble.

1284
01:42:39,029 --> 01:42:40,447
We can't leave.

1285
01:42:42,241 --> 01:42:45,244
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1286
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:46,995
Let's use them.

1287
01:42:47,079 --> 01:42:48,455
General, are you seeing this?

1288
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:49,915
Two more X-wings down.

1289
01:42:49,998 --> 01:42:52,376
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1290
01:42:52,459 --> 01:42:55,128
And their weapon
will be fully charged in ten minutes.

1291
01:42:55,212 --> 01:42:57,339
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1292
01:43:23,782 --> 01:43:24,783
Ah.

1293
01:43:24,866 --> 01:43:27,202
Girl knows her stuff.

1294
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:38,630
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1295
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,800
You're right. That's a better idea.

1296
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:43,885
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1297
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:45,637
Detonator.

1298
01:43:45,721 --> 01:43:47,389
We'll meet back here.

1299
01:44:32,809 --> 01:44:33,810
<i>Find them.</i>

1300
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:36,581
Ben!

1301
01:45:49,344 --> 01:45:50,470
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1302
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:54,057
<i>I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.</i>

1303
01:46:13,326 --> 01:46:16,830
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1304
01:46:17,414 --> 01:46:19,291
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>

1305
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:21,668
The face of my son.

1306
01:46:43,523 --> 01:46:45,692
Your son is gone.

1307
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:49,321
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1308
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:51,239
So I destroyed him.

1309
01:46:53,325 --> 01:46:55,702
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1310
01:46:56,953 --> 01:46:58,663
But it's not true.

1311
01:46:59,998 --> 01:47:02,083
My son is alive.

1312
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:03,627
No.

1313
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:05,921
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1314
01:47:06,004 --> 01:47:08,757
Snoke is using you for your power.

1315
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,634
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1316
01:47:15,889 --> 01:47:17,557
You know it's true.

1317
01:47:23,188 --> 01:47:24,189
It's too late.

1318
01:47:24,272 --> 01:47:25,857
No, it's not.

1319
01:47:25,941 --> 01:47:27,692
Leave here with me. Come home.

1320
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:30,862
We miss you.

1321
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:41,706
I'm being torn apart.

1322
01:47:44,543 --> 01:47:46,711
I want to be free of this pain.

1323
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:53,176
I know what I have to do...

1324
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:55,387
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1325
01:47:59,307 --> 01:48:00,392
Will you help me?

1326
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:02,310
Yes. Anything.

1327
01:48:50,609 --> 01:48:53,445
No!

1328
01:49:00,368 --> 01:49:01,620
Thank you.

1329
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:10,128
No.

1330
01:50:25,453 --> 01:50:27,038
The oscillator's been damaged...

1331
01:50:27,122 --> 01:50:28,873
but is still functional.

1332
01:50:28,957 --> 01:50:31,459
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1333
01:50:42,721 --> 01:50:44,180
The <i>Falcon's</i> this way.

1334
01:51:05,076 --> 01:51:06,411
We're not done yet.

1335
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:11,416
You're a monster.

1336
01:51:11,541 --> 01:51:13,418
It's just us now.

1337
01:51:14,586 --> 01:51:16,087
Han Solo can't save you.

1338
01:51:24,888 --> 01:51:26,681
Rey!

1339
01:51:29,476 --> 01:51:30,977
Rey.

1340
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:32,062
Rey!

1341
01:51:33,897 --> 01:51:35,523
Oh, no. No, no.

1342
01:51:35,607 --> 01:51:36,608
Rey.

1343
01:51:38,818 --> 01:51:40,361
Traitor!

1344
01:51:50,914 --> 01:51:52,457
That lightsaber.

1345
01:51:53,583 --> 01:51:54,626
It belongs to me.

1346
01:51:54,709 --> 01:51:56,377
Come get it.

1347
01:53:44,194 --> 01:53:45,278
We just lost <i>R-1.</i>

1348
01:53:45,904 --> 01:53:47,197
<i>We're overwhelmed.</i>

1349
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,573
What do we do? It isn't working.

1350
01:53:49,324 --> 01:53:51,534
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1351
01:53:52,577 --> 01:53:54,495
<i>Looks like our friends got in.</i>

1352
01:53:55,121 --> 01:53:56,998
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

1353
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:58,249
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1354
01:53:58,333 --> 01:53:59,876
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

1355
01:53:59,959 --> 01:54:01,002
Give it everything you got.

1356
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:15,266
I need some help here.
I need some help!

1357
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:16,601
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

1358
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:19,062
I'm hit!

1359
01:54:24,567 --> 01:54:26,486
All teams, I'm going in.

1360
01:54:26,611 --> 01:54:27,779
<i>Pull up and cover me.</i>

1361
01:54:27,862 --> 01:54:29,614
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

1362
01:54:35,745 --> 01:54:37,622
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1363
01:54:39,123 --> 01:54:40,291
Prepare to fire.

1364
01:56:13,384 --> 01:56:14,802
You need a teacher.

1365
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:18,473
I could show you the ways of the Force.

1366
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,185
The Force?

1367
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,378
All eyes on that TIE fighter.

1368
01:58:12,462 --> 01:58:14,046
We're losing power rapidly!

1369
01:58:16,424 --> 01:58:18,342
Lieutenant!
Get back to your station!

1370
01:58:18,426 --> 01:58:21,721
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

1371
01:58:21,846 --> 01:58:23,347
Supreme Leader.

1372
01:58:24,223 --> 01:58:26,184
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1373
01:58:26,267 --> 01:58:28,394
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1374
01:58:28,603 --> 01:58:32,648
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1375
01:58:33,733 --> 01:58:35,610
It is time...

1376
01:58:35,693 --> 01:58:38,029
to complete his training.

1377
01:58:40,364 --> 01:58:41,365
Finn!

1378
01:58:42,116 --> 01:58:43,326
Finn.

1379
01:59:32,458 --> 01:59:35,545
- All teams, I got eyes on them.
- Yes!

1380
01:59:58,484 --> 02:00:01,612
Our job's done here. Let's go home.

1381
02:00:16,794 --> 02:00:19,130
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

1382
02:00:19,255 --> 02:00:20,464
We've got a heartbeat.

1383
02:01:22,526 --> 02:01:24,153
R2-D2!

1384
02:01:25,029 --> 02:01:26,030
You've come back.

1385
02:01:29,992 --> 02:01:31,410
You found what?

1386
02:01:31,535 --> 02:01:33,537
How dare you call me that!

1387
02:01:35,915 --> 02:01:38,000
Find Master Luke, how?

1388
02:01:38,084 --> 02:01:39,126
Come, R2.

1389
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:41,212
We must go tell the others at once!

1390
02:01:42,546 --> 02:01:43,631
General.

1391
02:01:43,714 --> 02:01:45,883
Excuse me, General.

1392
02:01:50,471 --> 02:01:52,973
R2 may contain some
much-needed good news.

1393
02:01:53,641 --> 02:01:55,101
Tell me.

1394
02:02:05,486 --> 02:02:06,904
Yeah. All right, buddy. Hold on.

1395
02:02:21,335 --> 02:02:22,962
The map, it is complete.

1396
02:02:23,587 --> 02:02:25,256
Luke.

1397
02:02:25,339 --> 02:02:26,924
Oh, my dear friend...

1398
02:02:27,049 --> 02:02:28,592
how I've missed you.

1399
02:02:45,568 --> 02:02:47,611
We'll see each other again.

1400
02:02:47,695 --> 02:02:49,613
I believe that.

1401
02:02:57,788 --> 02:02:59,582
Thank you, my friend.

1402
02:03:14,472 --> 02:03:16,307
Rey.

1403
02:03:17,975 --> 02:03:20,770
May the Force be with you.
