1
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:07,292
We're not clear yet.

2
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:09,784
There are still 30 pallets
of cannon shells in C bunker.

3
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,868
Forget the munitions,
there's no time.

4
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,710
Just get everyone
on the transports.

5
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:16,026
Oh, no.

6
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:30,231
We've caught them in the
middle of their evacuation.

7
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:34,592
I have my orders from
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

8
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:38,425
This is where we snuff out
the Resistance once and for all.

9
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:41,635
Tell Captain Canady
to prime his dreadnought.

10
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:47,314
Incinerate their base, destroy their
transports and obliterate their fleet.

11
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:05,712
General, Resistance ship approaching.
Guns and shields in attack mode.

12
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:09,145
A single light fighter.

13
00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:20,985
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

14
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:22,372
We've pulled crazier stunts than this.

15
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:24,432
Just for the record,
Commander Dameron,

16
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,069
I'm with the droid on this one.

17
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:28,113
Thank you for your support, General.

18
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,425
Happy beeps.

19
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:32,596
Attention.

20
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,612
This is Commander Poe Dameron
of the Republic fleet,

21
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:37,628
I have an urgent
communiqué for General Hugs.

22
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:39,149
Patch him through.

23
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:41,990
This is General Hux
of the First Order.

24
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:44,467
The Republic is no more.

25
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:47,867
Your fleet are Rebel scum
and war criminals.

26
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:50,510
Tell your precious princess
there will be no terms,

27
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:53,190
there will be no surrender.

28
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,387
Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.

29
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:59,514
This is Hux.
You and your friends are doomed.

30
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:02,753
We will wipe your filth
from the galaxy.

31
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,712
Okay. I'll hold.

32
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:07,396
Hello?

33
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:10,270
Hello? Yup.
I'm still here.

34
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:12,754
Can he hear me?

35
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,144
- Hugs?
- He can.

36
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:17,547
With an "H." Skinny guy.
Kinda pasty.

37
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:21,033
I can hear you.
Can you hear me?

38
00:04:21,236 --> 00:04:22,996
Look, I can't hold forever.
If you reach him,

39
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,108
tell him Leia has
an urgent message for him...

40
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:28,551
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

41
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:30,468
...about his mother.

42
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,349
Open fire!

43
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:34,052
BB-8, punch it!

44
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:45,275
He's going for the dreadnought.

45
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:46,356
Ha!

46
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:48,071
He's insane.

47
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:52,193
Woo-hoo! That's got a kick.

48
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:08,353
All right, taking out the cannons now.

49
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:09,556
Tallie, start your approach.

50
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:10,756
Copy that.

51
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:15,194
Captain Canady,
why aren't you blasting that puny ship?

52
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,156
That puny ship is too small
and at too close range.

53
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:19,669
We need to scramble our fighters

54
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,874
five bloody minutes ago.

55
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,316
He'll never penetrate our armor.

56
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,193
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

57
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:27,352
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

58
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:30,944
One cannon left.

59
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:32,435
And here comes the parade.

60
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,076
Yeah! Yeah, I see him!

61
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:46,385
No, no, no.
Damn it!

62
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,836
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

63
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,252
We gotta take out that last cannon

64
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:50,345
or our bombers are toast.

65
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,835
Work your magic, buddy.

66
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:08,909
Are the auto-cannons primed?

67
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,076
Primed and ready, sir.

68
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,430
What are we waiting for?

69
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:12,871
Fire on the base!

70
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:18,476
Punch it!

71
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,236
The last transport is in the air.
The evacuation is complete.

72
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,184
You did it, Poe.

73
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:34,593
Now get your squad back here
so we can get out of this place.

74
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:35,745
No, General...

75
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:37,394
We can do this.
We have the chance

76
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:38,625
to take out a dreadnought.

77
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:44,268
These things are fleet killers.

78
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:45,476
We can't let it get away.

79
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:46,710
Disengage now...

80
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,674
Commander.
That is an or...

81
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:58,587
Wipe that nervous expression
off your face, Threepio.

82
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:01,789
Oh. Well,
I will certainly try, General.

83
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,105
Nervous?

84
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,269
Let's go, BB-8.

85
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:08,551
It's now or never!

86
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:34,352
Yes!

87
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:37,988
All clear! Bring the bombs.

88
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:39,076
Captain,

89
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:41,513
Resistance bombers approaching.

90
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,985
Of course they are.

91
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,476
Bombers, keep that tight formation.

92
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:59,632
Fighters, protect the bombers.

93
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,332
It's not every day we
get a shot at a dreadnought,

94
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,391
so let's make this count.

95
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,551
Copy that, Blue Leader.

96
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,716
You get us there,
we'll give it to them.

97
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,756
- Copy. We're on it.
- Fighters incoming.

98
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,349
Gunners, look alive.

99
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:14,692
Snubfighters at two-ten!

100
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:15,852
- They're coming in!
- Form up!

101
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:17,275
They're everywhere!

102
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:18,676
Here they come.

103
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:19,812
Incoming fighters.
Form up.

104
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:21,236
Vector in at attack speed.

105
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:22,994
- Pull up!
- Flank right.

106
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,830
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday! We're going down!

107
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:29,386
Recharge the auto-cannons.

108
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:31,554
Target their cruiser.

109
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:39,266
I see it. Tallie,
they've targeted the fleet

110
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,074
and begun the priming sequence.

111
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:42,271
Copy that.

112
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:43,436
We're almost there.

113
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,908
Bombardiers, begin your drop sequence.

114
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:56,036
I've got a visual on the target.

115
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:58,550
We're approaching the sweet spot.

116
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,876
Bombs are armed.

117
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:28,110
- Auto-cannons aimed.
- Forty seconds to full charge.

118
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,631
Destroy that last bomber!

119
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:38,429
Paige, come in.
We're over the target.

120
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,892
Why aren't your bay doors open?

121
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,191
You're the only bomber left.
It's all down to you!

122
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:52,915
- Nix!
- Paige!

123
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,907
Drop the payload now!

124
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,265
Look out!

125
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:08,304
No!

126
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:11,305
Bombs away!

127
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:40,952
Direct hit! Dreadnought down!

128
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,052
General, Supreme Leader Snoke

129
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:19,192
is making contact from his ship.

130
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:21,756
Excellent.

131
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,515
I'll take it in my chambers.

132
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:28,710
General Hux.

133
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:31,788
Ah, good. Supreme Lea...

134
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:36,864
My disappointment

135
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:41,472
in your performance cannot be overstated.

136
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,786
They can't get away, Supreme Leader.

137
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:48,152
We have them tied on the end of a string.

138
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,311
Rey!

139
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,355
Well done, pal.

140
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:25,148
"Finn naked leaking bag"?
What? Did you fry a chip?

141
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,234
Finn! Finn, buddy.

142
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:36,469
It's so good to see you.

143
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:37,671
What? Let's...

144
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,913
We need to get you dressed.
Come on.

145
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:42,452
You must have a thousand questions.

146
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:43,750
Where's Rey?

147
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:48,354
Master Skywalker?

148
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:14,227
Master Skywalker?

149
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:17,514
I'm from the Resistance.

150
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:20,554
Your sister Leia sent me.
We need your help.

151
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:30,988
Hello?

152
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,795
Go away.

153
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,075
Chewie, what are you doing here?

154
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:14,236
He said you're coming back with us.

155
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:15,356
How did you find me?

156
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,188
Long story.
We'll tell you on the Falcon.

157
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:19,749
Falcon?

158
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,755
Wait.

159
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:28,987
Where's Han?

160
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,910
Tied on a string indeed,
General Hux. Well done.

161
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:41,273
The Resistance will soon
be in our grasp.

162
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:43,671
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

163
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,074
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur

164
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:57,586
in such a place of power?

165
00:16:57,756 --> 00:17:01,510
A cur's weakness,
properly manipulated,

166
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:05,385
can be a sharp tool.

167
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:09,228
How's your wound?

168
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:11,585
It's nothing.

169
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:13,356
Hmm.

170
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:18,665
The mighty Kylo Ren.

171
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:21,234
When I found you,

172
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:25,995
I saw what all masters live to see.

173
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:30,035
Raw, untamed power.

174
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:35,634
And beyond that, something truly special.

175
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:38,910
The potential of your bloodline.

176
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:44,273
A new Vader.

177
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:52,510
Now I fear

178
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:56,835
I was mistaken.

179
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,590
I've given everything I have to you.

180
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:03,955
To the dark side.

181
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,028
Take that ridiculous thing off.

182
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:19,990
Yes, there it is.

183
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:24,832
You have too much
of your father's heart in you,

184
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:25,951
young Solo.

185
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:27,748
I killed Han Solo.

186
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:30,833
When the moment came,
I didn't hesitate.

187
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:32,554
And look at you,

188
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:35,946
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

189
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,584
You were unbalanced,

190
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:42,471
bested by a girl
who had never held a lightsaber!

191
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:43,904
You failed!

192
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:48,515
Skywalker lives.

193
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:54,426
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

194
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:56,473
And as long as it does,

195
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,946
hope lives in the galaxy.

196
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:05,389
I thought you would be the one
to snuff it out.

197
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:09,633
Alas, you're no Vader.

198
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:13,310
You're just a child

199
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:17,431
in a mask.

200
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:51,271
Prepare my ship.

201
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:58,988
There's no light
left in Kylo Ren.

202
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:01,548
He's only getting stronger.

203
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:05,465
The First Order will control
all the major systems within weeks.

204
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,632
We need your help.

205
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:10,390
We need the Jedi Order back.

206
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,151
We need Luke Skywalker.

207
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:21,709
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

208
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:23,875
Did you hear a word I just said?

209
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:24,956
You think what?

210
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:29,752
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword
and face down the whole First Order?

211
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,594
What did you think
was going to happen here?

212
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:34,711
You think that I came

213
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:38,994
to the most unfindable place
in the galaxy for no reason at all?

214
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:40,909
Go away.

215
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:43,273
I'm not leaving without you!

216
00:21:51,236 --> 00:21:52,351
Careful!

217
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:29,909
You're wasting your time.

218
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,427
Who are you?

219
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:55,391
I know this place.

220
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:03,789
Built a thousand generations ago

221
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:06,865
to keep these.

222
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,235
The original Jedi texts.

223
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:17,266
Just like me,
they're the last of the Jedi religion.

224
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,189
You've seen this place.

225
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,233
You've seen this island.

226
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,827
Only in dreams.

227
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:29,833
Who are you?

228
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:31,236
The Resistance sent me.

229
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:32,590
They sent you?

230
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:34,987
What's special about you?

231
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:38,792
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

232
00:24:39,316 --> 00:24:41,750
- No one's from nowhere.
- Jakku.

233
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:44,709
All right,
that is pretty much nowhere.

234
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,510
Why are you here, Rey,
from nowhere?

235
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:48,711
The Resistance sent me.

236
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:50,991
We need your help.

237
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:52,292
The First Order's become unstoppable.

238
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:54,955
Why are you here?

239
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:10,946
Something inside me has always been there.

240
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:15,267
But now it's awake.

241
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:18,715
And I'm afraid.

242
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:20,985
I don't know what it is

243
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:23,507
or what to do with it.

244
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:25,075
And I need help.

245
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:27,946
You need a teacher.

246
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:30,185
I can't teach you.

247
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,031
Why not?

248
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:35,352
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

249
00:25:35,516 --> 00:25:39,270
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

250
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:41,911
I came to this island to die.

251
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:46,628
It's time for the Jedi to end.

252
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:48,670
Why?

253
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:52,344
Leia sent me here with hope.

254
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:55,349
If she was wrong,
she deserves to know why.

255
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:57,710
We all do.

256
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:29,392
- You're demoted.
- What? Wait!

257
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,786
- We took down a dreadnought.
- At what cost?

258
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:33,674
You start an attack,
you follow it through.

259
00:26:33,836 --> 00:26:35,428
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

260
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:38,633
There are things that you cannot solve

261
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:41,708
by jumping in an X-wing
and blowing something up!

262
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:43,832
I need you to learn that.

263
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:46,713
There were heroes on that mission.

264
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:48,355
Dead heroes.

265
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:50,515
No leaders.

266
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,907
We're really nowhere.

267
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,907
How's Rey gonna find us now?

268
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:03,835
A cloaked binary beacon.

269
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,509
To light her way home.

270
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:09,072
All right, so until she gets back,
what's the plan?

271
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,033
We need to find a new base.

272
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,231
One with enough power

273
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:16,065
to get a distress signal
to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.

274
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,748
Proximity alert!

275
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:21,036
They found us.

276
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:22,635
That's impossible.

277
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:36,987
That's Snoke's ship.

278
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,555
You gotta be kidding me.

279
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:40,452
- Can we jump to lightspeed?
- We have enough

280
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:41,796
fuel resources for just one jump.

281
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,292
Well, then, do it.
We gotta get out of here.

282
00:27:43,316 --> 00:27:44,635
Wait.

283
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:48,316
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

284
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:50,596
That's impossible.

285
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,116
Yes.

286
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,588
And they've done it.

287
00:27:56,756 --> 00:27:57,852
So if we jump through lightspeed,

288
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,772
they'll just find us again
and we'll be out of fuel.

289
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:00,796
They've got us.

290
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:02,708
Not yet, they don't.

291
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:05,156
Permission to jump in an X-wing
and blow something up?

292
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:06,635
Permission granted.

293
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:08,275
Admiral, swing us around!

294
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,552
Full astern.
Rotate shields!

295
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:13,753
To your stations! Move, move, move!

296
00:28:27,636 --> 00:28:28,636
Follow my lead.

297
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:36,070
Green Squadron to launch position.

298
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,352
Clear all launch traffic.

299
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:44,026
Don't wait for me!
Jump in and fire her up!

300
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:48,149
Technicians,
lock down supplies for launch conditions.

301
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:20,827
Move! Move!

302
00:29:37,596 --> 00:29:38,995
Poe, are you all right?

303
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:41,351
We need to get out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

304
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:42,915
We need to what?

305
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:44,429
Full engines ahead.

306
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:48,271
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers
and the fighters will fall back.

307
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:50,108
All craft, full engines!

308
00:29:50,276 --> 00:29:52,312
Concentrate rear shields.

309
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:52,832
Ren, the Resistance
have pulled out of range.

310
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:54,549
We can't cover you at this distance.

311
00:30:54,716 --> 00:30:57,071
Return to the fleet.

312
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:01,305
What is the point of all this

313
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:04,866
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

314
00:31:05,036 --> 00:31:07,027
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

315
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:09,076
They can't lose us,
but they can keep at a range

316
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:11,356
where our cannons are ineffective
against their shields.

317
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:14,635
Well, keep up the barrage.

318
00:31:14,796 --> 00:31:17,264
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

319
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,545
Very good, sir.

320
00:31:18,716 --> 00:31:22,106
They won't last long
burning fuel like this.

321
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:24,471
It's just a matter of time.

322
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:33,872
Move! Out of the way, everybody!
Give room!

323
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:36,305
Life signs are weak,
but she's fighting.

324
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:09,636
Artoo?

325
00:34:10,476 --> 00:34:12,148
Artoo!

326
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:15,389
Yes.

327
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:16,972
Yeah, I know.

328
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,426
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

329
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,952
Old friend.

330
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:28,632
I wish I could make you understand.

331
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:31,667
But I'm not coming back.

332
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:35,752
Nothing can make me
change my mind.

333
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,550
Years ago, you served my father
in the Clone Wars.

334
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,476
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

335
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:47,892
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person...

336
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,190
That was a cheap move.

337
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:51,132
...but my ship
has fallen under attack,

338
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,624
and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

339
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,712
This is our most desperate hour.

340
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,389
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

341
00:34:58,516 --> 00:34:59,710
You're my only hope.

342
00:35:11,116 --> 00:35:13,789
Tomorrow at dawn.

343
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:15,835
Three lessons.

344
00:35:15,996 --> 00:35:18,590
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi

345
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:21,028
and why they need to end.

346
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,515
General Organa,

347
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:34,665
Leia,

348
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:37,509
is unconscious but recovering.

349
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,952
That's the only good news I have.

350
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:45,874
Admiral Ackbar,
all our leadership, they're gone.

351
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:48,996
Leia was the sole survivor
on the bridge.

352
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:50,390
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

353
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:54,674
If she were here, she'd say
save your sorrow for after the fight.

354
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:56,945
To that end,

355
00:35:57,996 --> 00:36:01,750
the chain of command is clear
as to who should take her place.

356
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:04,514
Vice Admiral Holdo

357
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,708
of the cruiser Ninka.

358
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:09,229
Thank you, Commander.

359
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:16,750
Four hundred of us

360
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,429
on three ships.

361
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:22,550
We're the very last
of the Resistance.

362
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:26,786
But we're not alone.

363
00:36:26,956 --> 00:36:29,151
In every corner of the galaxy,

364
00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:32,114
the downtrodden and oppressed
know our symbol,

365
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:34,148
and they put their hope in it.

366
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,508
We are the spark

367
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:40,145
that will light the fire that
will restore the Republic.

368
00:36:41,196 --> 00:36:45,667
That spark,
this Resistance, must survive.

369
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:48,826
That is our mission.

370
00:36:50,316 --> 00:36:51,590
Now, to your stations.

371
00:36:54,196 --> 00:36:56,391
And may the Force be with us.

372
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:03,230
That's Admiral Holdo?

373
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:06,272
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

374
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:10,910
Not what I expected.

375
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:14,591
Vice Admiral?
Commander Dameron.

376
00:37:14,756 --> 00:37:17,596
With our current fuel consumption,
there's a very limited amount of time

377
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:19,612
that we can stay out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

378
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,991
Very kind of you
to make me aware.

379
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:23,532
Let's get me those fuel projections.

380
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:25,876
And we need to shake 'em
before we can find a new base, so,

381
00:37:25,956 --> 00:37:27,309
what's our plan?

382
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:29,273
Our plan, captain?

383
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:31,828
Not commander, right?

384
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:34,146
Wasn't it Leia's last official act
to demote you

385
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:35,669
for your dreadnought plan

386
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:38,671
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

387
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:43,435
"Captain." "Commander."

388
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:44,876
You can call me whatever you like.

389
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,634
I just wanna know what's going on.

390
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:48,465
Of course you do.

391
00:37:48,956 --> 00:37:49,956
I understand.

392
00:37:50,556 --> 00:37:53,468
I've dealt with plenty
of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

393
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:54,996
You're impulsive.

394
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:57,991
Dangerous.

395
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:00,948
And the last thing
we need right now.

396
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:05,909
So stick to your post
and follow my orders.

397
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,892
Turbolink banks seven and eight

398
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:22,793
are offline due to maintenance.

399
00:38:56,556 --> 00:38:57,830
What are you doing here?

400
00:38:57,996 --> 00:38:59,395
Hey. Hi.

401
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:02,390
Uh, I was...
You know, I was just...

402
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:03,784
You're Finn!

403
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:05,950
The Finn!

404
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:08,188
- The Finn?
- Sorry.

405
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:10,114
I work behind pipes all day.

406
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:14,071
Doing talking with Resistance heroes
is not my forte.

407
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:16,430
Doing...

408
00:39:16,596 --> 00:39:17,711
Doing talking.

409
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,395
I'm Rose.

410
00:39:20,756 --> 00:39:21,871
Breathe.

411
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:24,072
- Okay.
- Yeah.

412
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,706
Look, I'm not a Resistance hero,
but it was nice talking to you, Rose.

413
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:32,708
May the Force be with you.

414
00:39:33,716 --> 00:39:35,991
Wow. You, too.

415
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:40,388
Okay. But you are a hero.

416
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:44,034
You left the First Order,
what you did on the Starkiller Base...

417
00:39:44,196 --> 00:39:45,812
When we heard about it,
my sister Paige said,

418
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:47,394
"Rose, that's a real hero."

419
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:49,105
"Know right from wrong

420
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,156
"and don't run away
when it gets hard," she said.

421
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:52,332
You know...

422
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,074
Just this morning, I've had to stun

423
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:56,431
three people trying to
jump ship in this escape pod.

424
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:58,666
- What?
- They were running away.

425
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:00,185
That's disgraceful.

426
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:02,271
I know.

427
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:06,276
Anyway, uh...

428
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:08,108
Gotta get back to
what I was doing, so...

429
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:09,595
What were you doing?

430
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:11,390
Uh, just...

431
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,356
- Doing some checks.
- Checking the escape pods.

432
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,831
- No, it's routine checks.
- By boarding one

433
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:18,995
with a packed bag.

434
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:20,716
Okay.

435
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,932
Listen, I'm...

436
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:37,587
I can't move.
I can't move.

437
00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:39,633
- I know.
- What happened?

438
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:41,732
I'm taking you to the brig
and turning you in for desertion.

439
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:42,905
I was not deserting.

440
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:45,306
- I told you that...
- My sister just died

441
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,068
protecting the fleet.

442
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,147
And you were running away.

443
00:40:50,196 --> 00:40:51,311
I'm sorry.

444
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:52,716
But this fleet is doomed,

445
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:55,026
and if my friend comes back to it,
she's doomed, too.

446
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:56,471
I've gotta get this...

447
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,833
I gotta get this beacon
far away from here.

448
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:01,349
Then she'll find me and be safe.

449
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:04,073
You're a selfish traitor.

450
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:06,236
Look, we can't outrun
the First Order fleet.

451
00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:07,710
We can jump to lightspeed!

452
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:09,492
Well, they can track us
through lightspeed.

453
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:10,572
They can track us through lightspeed?

454
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:11,596
Yeah.

455
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:12,732
They'd just show up
thirty seconds later

456
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:13,812
and we'd have
blown a ton of fuel,

457
00:41:13,836 --> 00:41:15,952
which, by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

458
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:18,354
They can track us through lightspeed.

459
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,676
Yes. And they could...

460
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:21,196
I can't feel my teeth.

461
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:23,155
What did you shoot me with?

462
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:24,316
Active tracking.

463
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:25,511
What now?

464
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:27,372
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

465
00:41:27,396 --> 00:41:29,910
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

466
00:41:30,076 --> 00:41:31,812
- They're only tracking us...
- Only tracking us...

467
00:41:31,836 --> 00:41:33,110
...from the lead ship.

468
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:34,675
But we can't get to the tracker.

469
00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:36,932
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

470
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:38,412
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

471
00:41:38,436 --> 00:41:40,825
...has a dedicated power breaker.

472
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:43,824
But... Wait, but who knows
where the breaker room

473
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:44,916
is on a Star Destroyer?

474
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:49,073
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

475
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:50,784
If I can get us there,

476
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:53,107
I can shut their tracker down.

477
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,592
Just give it to me
one more time, simpler.

478
00:41:55,756 --> 00:41:59,066
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

479
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:00,305
So we blow that one up?

480
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,812
I like where your head's at, but no.

481
00:42:01,836 --> 00:42:03,652
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

482
00:42:03,676 --> 00:42:04,676
But if we can...

483
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:07,012
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer
and disable the tracker

484
00:42:07,036 --> 00:42:08,372
without them realizing, then we can...

485
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:10,466
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

486
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:13,025
- About six minutes.
- Sneak on board.

487
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:16,869
Disable the tracker.

488
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:20,471
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

489
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:23,876
Hmm.

490
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:29,876
How'd you two meet?

491
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:33,836
Just luck.

492
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:36,665
Yeah?

493
00:42:36,956 --> 00:42:38,184
Good luck?

494
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:39,785
Not sure yet.

495
00:42:40,276 --> 00:42:41,629
Poe, we gotta do this.

496
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,991
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

497
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:48,316
If I must be
the sole voice of reason,

498
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:50,467
Admiral Holdo will never
agree to this plan.

499
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,270
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

500
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,996
It's a "need-to-know" plan,
and she doesn't.

501
00:42:57,156 --> 00:42:58,794
- That wasn't exactly my...
- All right,

502
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:00,309
you guys shut down that tracker.

503
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:01,996
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

504
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:03,116
The question is,

505
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:05,396
how do we sneak the two of you
onto Snoke's Destroyer?

506
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,652
We steal clearance codes.

507
00:43:06,676 --> 00:43:08,756
No, they're bio-hexacrypt
and rescrambled every hour.

508
00:43:10,516 --> 00:43:13,076
We can't get through their
security shields undetected.

509
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:14,984
Nobody can.

510
00:43:18,836 --> 00:43:20,349
Could I do it?

511
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:22,746
Of course I could do it.
But I can't do it.

512
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:24,788
I'm a little tied down right now.

513
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:26,150
Oh!

514
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,147
Maz? What is happening?

515
00:43:28,236 --> 00:43:31,592
Union dispute.
You do not want to hear about it.

516
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,428
But, lucky for you,

517
00:43:33,596 --> 00:43:37,350
there's exactly one guy I trust
who can crack that kind of security!

518
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:41,474
He's a master codebreaker,

519
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:44,668
an ace pilot,
a poet with a blaster.

520
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:48,276
Oh, my.

521
00:43:48,476 --> 00:43:50,716
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow
can do everything.

522
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:53,344
Oh, yes, he can.

523
00:43:54,756 --> 00:43:58,715
You'll find him with a red
plom bloom on his lapel

524
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:01,470
rolling at a high stakes table

525
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:03,827
in the casino on Canto Bight.

526
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:06,988
Canto Bight? No, no.
That's... Maz...

527
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:09,132
Is there any way that we can
take care of this ourselves?

528
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:11,829
Sorry, kiddo.
This is rarefied cracking.

529
00:44:12,356 --> 00:44:13,709
You wanna get on that Destroyer,

530
00:44:13,836 --> 00:44:15,349
I only know one option.

531
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:18,390
Find the Master Codebreaker.

532
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:49,105
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

533
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:57,591
You're not doing this.
The effort would kill you.

534
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:03,716
Can you see my surroundings?

535
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:05,349
You're gonna pay for what you did!

536
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:06,790
I can't see yours.

537
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:09,670
Just you.

538
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,315
So, no.

539
00:46:14,956 --> 00:46:17,311
This is something else.

540
00:46:23,276 --> 00:46:24,276
Luke.

541
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:26,388
What's that about?

542
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:43,385
I was cleaning my blaster.
It went off.

543
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,585
Let's get started.

544
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:53,235
Who were those things?

545
00:46:54,036 --> 00:46:55,355
Caretakers.

546
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:56,631
Island natives.

547
00:46:56,796 --> 00:46:59,185
They've kept up the Jedi structures
since they were built.

548
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:01,474
I don't think they like me.

549
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:03,308
Can't imagine why.

550
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:40,595
Master Skywalker,

551
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:42,412
we need you to bring the Jedi back

552
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:45,234
because Kylo Ren is strong
with the dark side of the Force.

553
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,864
Without the Jedi, we won't
stand a chance against him.

554
00:47:48,036 --> 00:47:50,345
What do you know
about the Force?

555
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:53,709
It's a power that Jedi have
that lets them control people

556
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:55,869
and make things float.

557
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:56,956
Impressive.

558
00:47:57,116 --> 00:47:59,072
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

559
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:02,827
Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed.

560
00:48:09,676 --> 00:48:12,748
The Force is not a power you have.

561
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:15,225
It's not about lifting rocks.

562
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:17,427
It's the energy between all things,

563
00:48:17,596 --> 00:48:19,666
a tension, a balance,

564
00:48:19,836 --> 00:48:22,111
that binds the universe together.

565
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:23,276
Okay.

566
00:48:24,436 --> 00:48:25,585
But what is it?

567
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:28,270
Close your eyes.

568
00:48:30,196 --> 00:48:31,549
Breathe.

569
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,276
Now,

570
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:35,865
reach out.

571
00:48:42,636 --> 00:48:43,671
I feel something.

572
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:44,852
- You feel it?
- Yes, I feel it.

573
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:45,996
- That's the Force.
- Really?

574
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:47,652
Wow, it must be
really strong with you.

575
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:48,676
I've never felt any...

576
00:48:48,836 --> 00:48:49,836
Ow!

577
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:53,904
You meant reach out like...

578
00:48:56,556 --> 00:48:57,556
I'll try again.

579
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:01,076
Breathe.

580
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,193
Just breathe.

581
00:49:08,356 --> 00:49:10,586
Reach out with your feelings.

582
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:17,150
What do you see?

583
00:49:21,236 --> 00:49:22,236
The island.

584
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:25,191
Life.

585
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:27,875
Death and decay,

586
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:30,869
that feeds new life.

587
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:33,591
Warmth.

588
00:49:34,716 --> 00:49:35,716
Cold.

589
00:49:37,996 --> 00:49:39,395
Peace.

590
00:49:40,996 --> 00:49:42,270
Violence.

591
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:44,795
And between it all?

592
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:46,596
Balance.

593
00:49:47,356 --> 00:49:48,584
An energy.

594
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:53,229
A Force.

595
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:56,468
And inside you?

596
00:49:57,636 --> 00:49:59,228
Inside me

597
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:02,466
that same Force.

598
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:06,754
And this is the lesson.

599
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:10,033
That Force does not
belong to the Jedi.

600
00:50:11,316 --> 00:50:14,069
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, is vanity.

601
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:16,392
Can you feel that?

602
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:19,794
There's something else

603
00:50:21,836 --> 00:50:23,269
beneath the island.

604
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:25,196
A place.

605
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,705
A dark place.

606
00:50:29,836 --> 00:50:30,951
Balance.

607
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:33,547
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

608
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:35,031
It's cold.

609
00:50:40,796 --> 00:50:41,865
It's calling me.

610
00:50:43,196 --> 00:50:44,231
Resist it, Rey.

611
00:50:45,356 --> 00:50:46,550
Rey?

612
00:50:49,156 --> 00:50:50,156
Rey!

613
00:50:58,996 --> 00:51:00,793
You went straight to the dark.

614
00:51:02,156 --> 00:51:03,836
That place was trying
to show me something.

615
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:05,707
It offered something you needed.

616
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:08,625
And you didn't even try
to stop yourself.

617
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:11,388
But I didn't see you.

618
00:51:13,356 --> 00:51:15,028
Nothing from you.

619
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,785
You've closed yourself off
from the Force.

620
00:51:24,356 --> 00:51:25,709
Of course you have.

621
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:30,148
I've seen this raw strength
only once before,

622
00:51:30,676 --> 00:51:32,428
in Ben Solo.

623
00:51:32,596 --> 00:51:34,314
It didn't scare me enough then.

624
00:51:35,516 --> 00:51:37,029
It does now.

625
00:51:49,436 --> 00:51:50,436
What was that?

626
00:51:50,596 --> 00:51:51,790
Nothing, admiral.

627
00:51:51,996 --> 00:51:53,349
Passing debris.

628
00:52:00,676 --> 00:52:02,507
The fleet's only got
18 hours of fuel left.

629
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:04,235
We gotta hurry.

630
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,512
Still can't reach the Resistance?

631
00:52:07,596 --> 00:52:09,268
Keep at it.

632
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:11,114
If you get through, check their status.

633
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:12,595
And ask about Finn.

634
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:49,752
Why is the Force connecting us?

635
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:51,116
You and I.

636
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:52,675
Murderous snake.

637
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:56,473
You're too late.
You lost. I found Skywalker.

638
00:52:57,756 --> 00:52:58,956
Did he tell you what happened?

639
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:02,506
The night I destroyed his temple,
did he tell you why?

640
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:05,270
I know everything
I need to know about you.

641
00:53:05,436 --> 00:53:06,949
You do?

642
00:53:09,516 --> 00:53:11,427
Ah, you do.

643
00:53:12,716 --> 00:53:14,627
You have that look in your eyes.

644
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:16,593
From the forest.

645
00:53:19,276 --> 00:53:20,504
When you called me a monster.

646
00:53:20,676 --> 00:53:22,792
You are a monster.

647
00:53:28,036 --> 00:53:29,389
Yes, I am.

648
00:53:53,716 --> 00:53:54,716
Okay.

649
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:57,146
We get in, we find this codebreaker,
we get out.

650
00:53:57,316 --> 00:53:59,511
You know this town? Canto Bight?

651
00:53:59,676 --> 00:54:00,870
From stories.

652
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:04,472
It's a terrible place filled with
the worst people in the galaxy.

653
00:54:04,596 --> 00:54:05,596
Great.

654
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:28,474
I told those two, I said,

655
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:31,309
"This is a public beach.
You can't park that shuttle here."

656
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:34,070
But they just lit off toward the casino.

657
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:42,629
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

658
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:44,588
All bets on the table
right now, right now!

659
00:54:44,716 --> 00:54:45,751
Place your bets here.

660
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,513
Aw, yes!
This place is great!

661
00:55:03,156 --> 00:55:04,475
Okay.

662
00:55:06,796 --> 00:55:10,345
Maz said this Master Codebreaker
would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

663
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,268
Let's find him and get out of here.

664
00:55:12,436 --> 00:55:14,472
Well played.
The house wins.

665
00:55:15,756 --> 00:55:16,812
Where are
your manners, more like?

666
00:55:16,836 --> 00:55:17,905
Come on!

667
00:55:41,676 --> 00:55:42,732
We've covered this whole casino.

668
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,756
Zero red plom blooms.

669
00:55:43,836 --> 00:55:45,476
Where is this guy?

670
00:55:50,236 --> 00:55:51,908
Were those what I think they were?

671
00:55:59,116 --> 00:56:01,107
- What are those things?
- Fathiers.

672
00:56:02,036 --> 00:56:03,549
I've never seen a real one.

673
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,875
Look, this whole place is beautiful.
I mean, come on.

674
00:56:07,636 --> 00:56:09,274
Why do you hate it so much?

675
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:11,510
Look closer.

676
00:56:16,716 --> 00:56:19,549
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

677
00:56:21,196 --> 00:56:24,472
The First Order stripped our ore
to finance their military

678
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:27,992
then shelled us
to test their weapons.

679
00:56:34,036 --> 00:56:36,106
They took everything we had.

680
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,996
And who do you think
these people are?

681
00:56:40,476 --> 00:56:43,912
There's only one business in the galaxy
that'll get you this rich.

682
00:56:44,596 --> 00:56:45,711
War.

683
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:48,551
Selling weapons to the First Order.

684
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:55,311
I wish I could put my fist through this
whole lousy, beautiful town.

685
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:03,791
Red plom bloom!

686
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:13,071
Red plom bloom!

687
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:14,425
The Master Codebreaker!

688
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:22,354
Yep, those are the shuttle parkers.

689
00:57:23,556 --> 00:57:24,556
All right.

690
00:57:24,676 --> 00:57:29,113
You two are under arrest
for parking violation 27B/6.

691
00:57:29,276 --> 00:57:30,332
You have the right to remain...

692
00:57:30,356 --> 00:57:32,472
- What was that?
- No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

693
00:57:32,556 --> 00:57:33,591
I'm on a roll.

694
00:59:17,636 --> 00:59:18,989
Lesson two.

695
00:59:19,196 --> 00:59:23,348
Now that they're extinct,
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

696
00:59:23,836 --> 00:59:26,589
But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds,

697
00:59:27,076 --> 00:59:29,112
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

698
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:30,585
Hypocrisy, hubris.

699
00:59:30,716 --> 00:59:31,716
That's not true.

700
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:34,476
At the height of their powers,
they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

701
00:59:34,596 --> 00:59:36,473
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

702
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:38,787
It was a Jedi Master
who was responsible

703
00:59:38,956 --> 00:59:42,073
for the training
and creation of Darth Vader.

704
00:59:42,236 --> 00:59:43,749
And a Jedi who saved him.

705
00:59:44,436 --> 00:59:45,994
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

706
00:59:46,156 --> 00:59:48,351
But you saw there was conflict inside him.

707
00:59:48,556 --> 00:59:51,150
You believed that he wasn't gone.
That he could be turned.

708
00:59:51,516 --> 00:59:53,188
And I became a legend.

709
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:56,706
For many years, there was balance

710
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:58,275
and then I saw

711
00:59:58,556 --> 00:59:59,556
Ben.

712
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:04,671
My nephew
with that mighty Skywalker blood.

713
01:00:04,836 --> 01:00:06,189
And in my hubris,

714
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:09,507
I thought I could train him,
I could pass on my strengths.

715
01:00:10,716 --> 01:00:14,026
Han was Han about it, but...

716
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:18,109
Leia

717
01:00:19,556 --> 01:00:21,911
trusted me with her son.

718
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:23,716
I took him,

719
01:00:24,756 --> 01:00:26,508
and a dozen students,

720
01:00:27,556 --> 01:00:29,069
and began a training temple.

721
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:33,227
By the time I realized

722
01:00:33,356 --> 01:00:36,553
I was no match for
the darkness rising in him,

723
01:00:37,156 --> 01:00:38,714
it was too late.

724
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,389
What happened?

725
01:00:44,836 --> 01:00:46,315
I went to confront him.

726
01:00:48,596 --> 01:00:50,268
And he turned on me.

727
01:00:50,676 --> 01:00:52,155
Ben, no!

728
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,392
He must have thought
I was dead.

729
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:00,304
When I came to,

730
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:04,068
the temple was burning.

731
01:01:05,516 --> 01:01:08,189
He had vanished
with a handful of my students.

732
01:01:09,276 --> 01:01:11,471
And slaughtered the rest.

733
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:14,907
Leia blamed Snoke,

734
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:16,824
but it was me.

735
01:01:17,556 --> 01:01:18,955
I failed.

736
01:01:22,476 --> 01:01:25,513
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

737
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:28,347
Jedi Master.

738
01:01:33,676 --> 01:01:35,348
A legend.

739
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:39,831
The galaxy may need a legend.

740
01:01:44,436 --> 01:01:48,714
I need someone to show me
my place in all this.

741
01:01:54,556 --> 01:01:56,274
And you didn't fail Kylo.

742
01:01:56,476 --> 01:01:58,114
Kylo failed you.

743
01:01:58,836 --> 01:02:00,508
I won't.

744
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,029
The main cruiser's
still keeping beyond range.

745
01:02:24,516 --> 01:02:26,347
But their medical frigate is out of fuel

746
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:29,228
and its shields are down.

747
01:02:29,396 --> 01:02:31,273
The beginning of their end.

748
01:02:32,756 --> 01:02:34,508
Destroy it.

749
01:02:37,556 --> 01:02:40,866
The last of our crew has been evacuated
and heading your way.

750
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:43,554
It's been an honor, admiral.

751
01:02:43,716 --> 01:02:45,593
Godspeed, Rebels!

752
01:02:48,956 --> 01:02:49,991
Admiral,

753
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:52,672
fuel reserves at six hours.

754
01:02:54,476 --> 01:02:56,512
Maintain our current course.

755
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,028
Steady on.

756
01:03:04,116 --> 01:03:05,116
Finn,

757
01:03:05,276 --> 01:03:07,392
Rose, where are you guys?

758
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:13,905
Deal me in.

759
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:18,036
Thanks.

760
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:23,193
Finn, the fleet
is running on fumes.

761
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:26,829
Without a codebreaker
to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer...

762
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:29,628
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

763
01:03:30,196 --> 01:03:32,790
Unless you got a thief in your pocket,
our plan is shot.

764
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:36,195
Um, I can do it.

765
01:03:40,356 --> 01:03:41,356
What?

766
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:44,151
What?

767
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:46,116
What?

768
01:03:46,276 --> 01:03:47,868
S-S-Sorry, I just

769
01:03:48,276 --> 01:03:50,312
couldn't help but overhear all the stuff

770
01:03:50,396 --> 01:03:53,354
that you were saying really loudly

771
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:55,389
while I was trying to sleep.

772
01:03:57,596 --> 01:03:58,995
Codebreaker?

773
01:03:59,956 --> 01:04:01,389
Thief?

774
01:04:02,356 --> 01:04:03,550
I can do it.

775
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:06,469
We're not talking about
picking pockets, okay?

776
01:04:07,516 --> 01:04:09,427
Yeah.

777
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:13,352
D-D-Don't let the wrapper
fool you, friend.

778
01:04:14,076 --> 01:04:17,591
Me and the First Order
codeage go way back.

779
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:20,551
And,

780
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:24,153
if the price is right,

781
01:04:25,476 --> 01:04:30,311
I could break you into
old man S-S-Snoke's boudoir.

782
01:04:32,116 --> 01:04:33,993
- No.
- We're... We got it covered.

783
01:04:37,636 --> 01:04:38,910
Ha-tuk-ga.

784
01:04:52,396 --> 01:04:54,148
- Did he just...
- Yeah.

785
01:04:55,716 --> 01:04:57,354
We gotta get out of here!
This way!

786
01:04:57,516 --> 01:04:58,585
Why you little...

787
01:05:03,716 --> 01:05:05,513
D-D-Did you do this?

788
01:05:08,636 --> 01:05:09,671
Hey, hands up!

789
01:05:10,836 --> 01:05:13,066
- Hands up!
- Yeah, man.

790
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:30,788
What's your story, roundie?

791
01:05:31,516 --> 01:05:32,585
They went this way!

792
01:05:37,356 --> 01:05:39,347
- Lock down all the exits.
- Wait.

793
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,508
That smelled great.

794
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:47,507
Those cops will be here
any minute. What now?

795
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:54,874
Whoa! Ooh!

796
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:22,554
No, wait.
Please, don't!

797
01:06:29,956 --> 01:06:31,236
We're with the Resistance.

798
01:06:37,196 --> 01:06:39,152
Roger that.
Checking the stables now.

799
01:06:46,076 --> 01:06:47,076
This way.

800
01:06:47,156 --> 01:06:48,436
They must have
come through here.

801
01:06:54,316 --> 01:06:55,316
Hyah!

802
01:07:01,196 --> 01:07:03,187
Go, go, go! Whoo!

803
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,836
Stop enjoying this!
Stop enjoying this!

804
01:07:17,316 --> 01:07:19,597
We've got them.
They're not going anywhere.

805
01:07:25,636 --> 01:07:26,636
Ahhh!

806
01:07:36,716 --> 01:07:37,716
Huh?

807
01:08:03,796 --> 01:08:05,476
Move, move, move!
Get out of the way!

808
01:08:07,236 --> 01:08:09,466
Our ship's on the beach straight ahead!

809
01:08:11,476 --> 01:08:12,476
We need cover!

810
01:08:23,356 --> 01:08:24,630
Too much cover!

811
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:38,271
There it is!

812
01:08:40,956 --> 01:08:42,787
- No!
- Come on!

813
01:08:58,036 --> 01:09:00,116
Let the herd go.
Stick with the perps.

814
01:09:05,596 --> 01:09:06,631
Where'd they go?

815
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:10,945
I think we lost him!

816
01:09:11,116 --> 01:09:12,932
Now we get down to the beach
and circle back around...

817
01:09:12,956 --> 01:09:13,956
Cliff!

818
01:09:24,116 --> 01:09:25,151
We're trapped.

819
01:09:28,116 --> 01:09:29,310
It was worth it, though.

820
01:09:29,956 --> 01:09:31,230
To tear up that town,

821
01:09:31,596 --> 01:09:32,824
make 'em hurt.

822
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:43,436
Go.

823
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:49,704
Now it's worth it.

824
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,196
There they are.

825
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:09,150
BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?

826
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:14,190
Ah.

827
01:10:15,196 --> 01:10:16,868
N-N-Need a lift?

828
01:11:10,756 --> 01:11:11,756
Luke.

829
01:11:13,076 --> 01:11:14,225
Leia.

830
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:24,953
I'd rather not do this now.

831
01:11:25,636 --> 01:11:26,989
Yeah, me, too.

832
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:30,948
Why did you hate your father?

833
01:11:35,396 --> 01:11:36,396
Do you have something,

834
01:11:36,516 --> 01:11:37,996
a cowl or something you could put on?

835
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:43,951
Why did you hate your father?
Give me an honest answer.

836
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:48,070
You had a father who loved you,
he gave a damn about you.

837
01:11:48,276 --> 01:11:50,312
- I didn't hate him.
- Then why?

838
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:51,716
Why what?

839
01:11:55,236 --> 01:11:56,669
Why what? Say it.

840
01:11:57,996 --> 01:11:59,315
Why did you...

841
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:02,072
Why did you kill him?

842
01:12:02,516 --> 01:12:03,710
I don't understand.

843
01:12:03,876 --> 01:12:04,876
No?

844
01:12:05,036 --> 01:12:06,636
Your parents threw you away
like garbage.

845
01:12:06,836 --> 01:12:08,906
- They didn't!
- They did.

846
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:10,873
But you can't stop needing them.

847
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:12,264
It's your greatest weakness.

848
01:12:13,116 --> 01:12:14,236
Looking for them everywhere,

849
01:12:14,356 --> 01:12:15,550
in Han Solo,

850
01:12:16,036 --> 01:12:17,833
now in Skywalker.

851
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,033
Did he tell you what happened
that night?

852
01:12:23,396 --> 01:12:24,396
Yes.

853
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:27,545
No.

854
01:12:29,316 --> 01:12:30,954
He had sensed my power,

855
01:12:32,276 --> 01:12:33,994
as he senses yours.

856
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:36,948
And he feared it.

857
01:12:53,796 --> 01:12:55,070
Liar.

858
01:12:59,516 --> 01:13:00,869
Let the past die.

859
01:13:02,476 --> 01:13:04,785
Kill it if you have to.

860
01:13:07,356 --> 01:13:10,075
That's the only way to become
what you were meant to be.

861
01:13:53,276 --> 01:13:55,187
No! No!

862
01:14:35,676 --> 01:14:37,075
Rey?

863
01:15:06,156 --> 01:15:08,829
I should have felt
trapped or panicked.

864
01:15:08,996 --> 01:15:10,475
But I didn't.

865
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:14,916
This didn't go on forever,

866
01:15:14,956 --> 01:15:17,106
I knew it was leading somewhere.

867
01:15:17,876 --> 01:15:20,344
And that, at the end,
it would show me what I came to see.

868
01:15:22,516 --> 01:15:23,915
Rey.

869
01:15:32,436 --> 01:15:34,631
Let me see them.

870
01:15:35,116 --> 01:15:37,107
My parents,

871
01:15:37,276 --> 01:15:39,346
please.

872
01:16:14,476 --> 01:16:16,546
I thought I'd find answers here.

873
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,509
I was wrong.

874
01:16:22,076 --> 01:16:23,828
I'd never felt so alone.

875
01:16:26,356 --> 01:16:27,755
You're not alone.

876
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:34,195
Neither are you.

877
01:16:35,236 --> 01:16:36,555
Rey?

878
01:16:44,356 --> 01:16:46,028
It isn't too late.

879
01:17:43,756 --> 01:17:44,791
Stop!

880
01:17:54,156 --> 01:17:57,068
Is it true?
Did you try to murder him?

881
01:17:57,236 --> 01:17:59,670
Leave this island now!

882
01:17:59,836 --> 01:18:01,030
Stop.

883
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:03,316
Stop!

884
01:18:07,876 --> 01:18:08,945
Did you do it?

885
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:11,147
Did you create Kylo Ren?

886
01:18:40,836 --> 01:18:42,716
Tell me the truth.

887
01:18:48,636 --> 01:18:50,592
I saw darkness.

888
01:18:52,396 --> 01:18:54,307
I'd sensed it building in him.

889
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:57,115
I'd seen it in moments
during his training.

890
01:18:57,636 --> 01:18:59,467
But then I looked inside,

891
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:02,669
and it was beyond
what I ever imagined.

892
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:10,066
Snoke had already turned his heart.

893
01:19:11,756 --> 01:19:14,509
He would bring destruction,
and pain, and death,

894
01:19:14,596 --> 01:19:17,633
and the end of everything I love
because of what he will become.

895
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:19,593
And for the briefest moment
of pure instinct,

896
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:21,951
I thought I could stop it.

897
01:19:24,036 --> 01:19:26,504
It passed like a fleeting shadow.

898
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:29,273
And I was left with shame,

899
01:19:30,596 --> 01:19:32,552
and with consequence.

900
01:19:33,316 --> 01:19:35,193
And the last thing I saw

901
01:19:35,716 --> 01:19:37,627
were the eyes of a frightened boy

902
01:19:37,716 --> 01:19:40,184
whose master had failed him.

903
01:19:41,876 --> 01:19:42,876
Ben, no!

904
01:19:49,796 --> 01:19:51,912
You failed him by thinking
his choice was made.

905
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:52,996
It wasn't.

906
01:19:53,436 --> 01:19:55,233
There's still conflict in him.

907
01:19:55,396 --> 01:19:58,035
If he were turned from the dark side,
that could shift the tide.

908
01:19:58,196 --> 01:19:59,948
This could be how we win.

909
01:20:00,116 --> 01:20:03,108
This is not going to go
the way you think.

910
01:20:03,636 --> 01:20:04,864
It is.

911
01:20:05,076 --> 01:20:07,829
Just now when we touched hands,

912
01:20:07,996 --> 01:20:09,270
I saw his future.

913
01:20:10,276 --> 01:20:11,914
As solid as I'm seeing you.

914
01:20:12,396 --> 01:20:15,911
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

915
01:20:16,116 --> 01:20:17,231
Rey,

916
01:20:17,716 --> 01:20:19,786
don't do this.

917
01:20:35,676 --> 01:20:37,268
Then he's our last hope.

918
01:21:18,356 --> 01:21:19,789
Master Yoda.

919
01:21:20,636 --> 01:21:23,070
Young Skywalker.

920
01:21:25,356 --> 01:21:26,789
I'm ending all of this.

921
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:29,584
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

922
01:21:29,756 --> 01:21:30,950
I'm gonna burn it down.

923
01:21:50,796 --> 01:21:51,945
Hmm.

924
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:09,789
Ah, Skywalker.

925
01:22:09,876 --> 01:22:10,911
Missed you, have I.

926
01:22:24,116 --> 01:22:25,754
So it is time

927
01:22:27,316 --> 01:22:29,113
for the Jedi Order to end.

928
01:22:29,276 --> 01:22:31,506
Time it is.

929
01:22:32,116 --> 01:22:33,595
Hmm.

930
01:22:36,236 --> 01:22:41,833
For you to look past
a pile of old books, hmm?

931
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:43,668
The sacred Jedi texts.

932
01:22:43,836 --> 01:22:45,986
Oh. Read them, have you?

933
01:22:46,716 --> 01:22:48,149
- Well, I...
- Page-turners

934
01:22:48,356 --> 01:22:49,584
they were not.

935
01:22:50,236 --> 01:22:52,113
Yes, yes, yes.

936
01:22:52,316 --> 01:22:53,635
Wisdom they held,

937
01:22:53,796 --> 01:22:57,266
but that library contained
nothing that the girl Rey

938
01:22:57,436 --> 01:22:59,347
does not already possess.

939
01:23:02,516 --> 01:23:04,188
Skywalker,

940
01:23:05,116 --> 01:23:07,027
still looking to the horizon.

941
01:23:07,196 --> 01:23:09,664
Never here, now, hmm?

942
01:23:09,876 --> 01:23:12,436
The need in front of your nose.

943
01:23:13,236 --> 01:23:14,236
Hmm?

944
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:17,754
I was weak.

945
01:23:18,996 --> 01:23:19,996
Unwise.

946
01:23:20,156 --> 01:23:22,716
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

947
01:23:23,436 --> 01:23:25,870
Lose Rey, we must not.

948
01:23:26,316 --> 01:23:29,114
I can't be what she needs me to be.

949
01:23:29,756 --> 01:23:31,951
Heeded my words not, did you?

950
01:23:32,396 --> 01:23:34,910
Pass on what you have learned.

951
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,192
Strength, mastery.

952
01:23:38,156 --> 01:23:39,748
But weakness,

953
01:23:39,916 --> 01:23:42,305
folly, failure also.

954
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:45,593
Yes, failure most of all.

955
01:23:45,756 --> 01:23:48,714
The greatest teacher, failure is.

956
01:23:58,036 --> 01:23:59,036
Luke,

957
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:05,026
we are what they grow beyond.

958
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:09,994
That is the true burden of all masters.

959
01:24:23,236 --> 01:24:25,192
Four parsecs to go.
This thing really cooks.

960
01:24:25,356 --> 01:24:27,028
I just hope we're in time.

961
01:24:27,196 --> 01:24:28,595
You can actually do this, right?

962
01:24:29,156 --> 01:24:31,147
Yeah, about that...

963
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:38,352
Guys, I can do it.

964
01:24:39,276 --> 01:24:41,995
But there exists a pre- "do it"
conversation about price.

965
01:24:42,756 --> 01:24:45,276
Once we're done, the Resistance
will give you whatever you want.

966
01:24:45,996 --> 01:24:47,036
What you got deposit-wise?

967
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:50,111
Are you kidding me?
Look at us.

968
01:24:51,196 --> 01:24:52,948
Is that Haysian smelt?

969
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:56,915
That's something.

970
01:24:57,076 --> 01:24:59,271
No, we gave you our word.
You're gonna get paid.

971
01:24:59,396 --> 01:25:00,590
That should be enough.

972
01:25:00,756 --> 01:25:02,030
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

973
01:25:03,156 --> 01:25:06,626
But no something, n-n-no doing.

974
01:25:06,796 --> 01:25:08,787
Okay, listen here, you've got...

975
01:25:09,356 --> 01:25:10,994
Do it.

976
01:25:14,036 --> 01:25:15,833
Now I can help.

977
01:25:18,316 --> 01:25:19,385
Give it back.

978
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:21,876
What?

979
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:24,026
Give it back!

980
01:25:24,196 --> 01:25:26,316
You have no idea how much
that medallion means to her.

981
01:25:26,636 --> 01:25:29,673
What are you... Why are you
ransacking your own ship?

982
01:25:32,116 --> 01:25:33,185
It's not your ship.

983
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:36,031
He says I stole it.

984
01:25:36,196 --> 01:25:38,391
- Yeah, I got that.
- We stole it.

985
01:25:40,316 --> 01:25:42,546
At least you're stealing
from the bad guys

986
01:25:43,196 --> 01:25:44,196
and helping the good.

987
01:25:44,356 --> 01:25:46,312
Good guys, bad guys,

988
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:48,512
made-up words.

989
01:25:49,236 --> 01:25:52,785
Let's see who formerly owned
this gorgeous hunk-uh.

990
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:58,111
Ah, this guy was an arms dealer.

991
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:02,113
Made his bank selling weapons
to the bad guys.

992
01:26:03,836 --> 01:26:04,836
Oh...

993
01:26:06,436 --> 01:26:07,915
And the good.

994
01:26:09,356 --> 01:26:12,268
Finn, let me learn you something big.

995
01:26:13,676 --> 01:26:15,792
It's all a machine, partner.

996
01:26:17,476 --> 01:26:20,309
Live free, don't join.

997
01:26:32,356 --> 01:26:34,745
That was the last of their support ships.

998
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,276
It's just their main cruiser now.

999
01:26:36,556 --> 01:26:38,035
And their fuel reserve?

1000
01:26:38,196 --> 01:26:39,914
By our calculation,

1001
01:26:40,076 --> 01:26:41,555
critical.

1002
01:26:45,796 --> 01:26:46,796
She in there?

1003
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:47,972
The admiral's banned you
from the bridge.

1004
01:26:47,996 --> 01:26:49,476
- Let's not have a scene.
- No, let's.

1005
01:26:49,596 --> 01:26:51,427
- Holdo?
- You're not allowed in here.

1006
01:26:51,556 --> 01:26:53,945
- Flyboy.
- Cut it, lady.

1007
01:26:54,036 --> 01:26:55,754
We had a fleet,
now we're down to one ship,

1008
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:57,554
and you've told us nothing!

1009
01:26:58,036 --> 01:27:01,267
Tell us that we have a plan!

1010
01:27:01,436 --> 01:27:02,436
That there's hope!

1011
01:27:02,596 --> 01:27:03,995
When I served under Leia,

1012
01:27:04,156 --> 01:27:06,624
she would say,
hope is like the sun.

1013
01:27:06,796 --> 01:27:09,310
If you only believe in it
when you can see it...

1014
01:27:09,476 --> 01:27:11,706
You'll never make it
through the night.

1015
01:27:12,156 --> 01:27:13,475
Yes.

1016
01:27:21,476 --> 01:27:23,592
Are you fueling up the transports?

1017
01:27:29,116 --> 01:27:30,390
You are.

1018
01:27:31,116 --> 01:27:32,344
All of them?

1019
01:27:33,636 --> 01:27:36,230
We're abandoning ship? Is that...

1020
01:27:36,636 --> 01:27:38,636
That's what you got?
That's what you brought us to?

1021
01:27:39,236 --> 01:27:40,236
Coward!

1022
01:27:41,116 --> 01:27:43,994
Those transport ships
are unarmed, unshielded.

1023
01:27:44,156 --> 01:27:46,431
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

1024
01:27:46,596 --> 01:27:49,315
We don't stand a chance.
No, you are not just a coward,

1025
01:27:49,476 --> 01:27:50,989
you are a traitor.

1026
01:27:51,716 --> 01:27:53,946
Get this man off my bridge.

1027
01:28:00,756 --> 01:28:03,132
Finn,
Holdo's loading the crew in the shuttle.

1028
01:28:03,156 --> 01:28:04,953
She's going to abandon ship.
Where are you?

1029
01:28:05,116 --> 01:28:06,834
Poe, we're on our way
back to the fleet.

1030
01:28:06,996 --> 01:28:08,145
We're so close.

1031
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:09,492
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

1032
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:11,632
Well, we found a codebreaker.

1033
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:13,212
We can shut the tracker down.

1034
01:28:13,236 --> 01:28:15,227
Just buy us a little more time.

1035
01:28:16,316 --> 01:28:17,954
All right. Hurry.

1036
01:28:23,156 --> 01:28:25,036
As soon as I launch,
you jump back out of range.

1037
01:28:25,076 --> 01:28:27,829
Stay there until you get my signal
for where to rendezvous.

1038
01:28:29,636 --> 01:28:32,434
If you see Finn before I do,

1039
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:33,516
tell him...

1040
01:28:35,716 --> 01:28:37,468
Yeah, perfect.
Tell him that.

1041
01:29:44,476 --> 01:29:46,785
Cloaking our approach.
We should be off their scopes.

1042
01:29:47,596 --> 01:29:49,905
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

1043
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:51,714
Blip bloppity bloop,

1044
01:29:52,756 --> 01:29:54,712
and slip right through.

1045
01:30:13,156 --> 01:30:16,273
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

1046
01:30:16,436 --> 01:30:17,585
They are trying to save us.

1047
01:30:17,756 --> 01:30:19,348
This is our best chance for escape.

1048
01:30:19,556 --> 01:30:21,612
You have to give Finn and Rose
all the time that you can.

1049
01:30:21,636 --> 01:30:23,991
You have bet the survival
of the Resistance

1050
01:30:24,156 --> 01:30:26,909
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

1051
01:30:27,076 --> 01:30:28,225
There's no time now.

1052
01:30:28,436 --> 01:30:30,492
We have to get clear of the cruiser.
Load the transports.

1053
01:30:30,516 --> 01:30:31,572
Right away, admiral.

1054
01:30:31,596 --> 01:30:32,772
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

1055
01:30:32,796 --> 01:30:34,752
Vice Admiral Holdo,

1056
01:30:34,836 --> 01:30:36,633
I am relieving you
of your command

1057
01:30:36,796 --> 01:30:40,072
for the survival of this ship,
its crew, and the Resistance.

1058
01:30:40,956 --> 01:30:43,186
I hope you understand
what you're doing.

1059
01:30:43,716 --> 01:30:44,716
Yeah.

1060
01:30:44,956 --> 01:30:46,212
I'm going to the bridge.

1061
01:30:46,236 --> 01:30:48,227
If they move, stun them.

1062
01:31:08,156 --> 01:31:09,908
...at least three cycles so far.

1063
01:31:10,076 --> 01:31:11,756
Yes, sir.
We are working on it.

1064
01:31:18,796 --> 01:31:20,707
I will do my best, sir.

1065
01:31:30,916 --> 01:31:32,110
Almost there.

1066
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:43,028
You don't have to do this.

1067
01:31:43,596 --> 01:31:45,188
I feel the conflict in you.

1068
01:31:45,356 --> 01:31:47,074
It's tearing you apart.

1069
01:31:48,116 --> 01:31:50,471
Ben, when we touched hands,

1070
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:52,149
I saw your future.

1071
01:31:52,356 --> 01:31:54,745
Just the shape of it,
but solid and clear.

1072
01:31:55,316 --> 01:31:57,546
You will not bow before Snoke.

1073
01:32:00,596 --> 01:32:02,154
You'll turn.

1074
01:32:04,396 --> 01:32:06,034
I'll help you.

1075
01:32:06,596 --> 01:32:08,109
I saw it.

1076
01:32:08,276 --> 01:32:09,914
I saw something, too.

1077
01:32:11,356 --> 01:32:12,356
Because of what I saw,

1078
01:32:12,516 --> 01:32:14,950
I know when the moment comes,
you'll be the one to turn.

1079
01:32:15,676 --> 01:32:17,473
You'll stand with me.

1080
01:32:18,156 --> 01:32:19,156
Rey,

1081
01:32:20,356 --> 01:32:22,665
I saw who your parents are.

1082
01:32:37,556 --> 01:32:41,868
Well done, my good
and faithful apprentice.

1083
01:32:42,036 --> 01:32:46,234
My faith in you is restored.

1084
01:32:47,356 --> 01:32:49,586
Young Rey.

1085
01:32:51,716 --> 01:32:53,274
Welcome.

1086
01:32:58,636 --> 01:32:59,910
So this is it.

1087
01:33:00,076 --> 01:33:01,953
The tracker's right behind this door.

1088
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:17,272
Haysian smelt.

1089
01:33:17,716 --> 01:33:19,115
Best conductor.

1090
01:33:27,716 --> 01:33:29,229
And you're welcome.

1091
01:33:31,316 --> 01:33:33,212
Good time to figure out
how we get back to the fleet?

1092
01:33:33,236 --> 01:33:34,908
I know where the nearest escape pods are.

1093
01:33:34,996 --> 01:33:35,996
Course you do.

1094
01:33:36,076 --> 01:33:37,873
BB-8, tell me something good.

1095
01:33:39,756 --> 01:33:40,950
Poe, we're almost there.

1096
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:42,452
Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.

1097
01:33:42,476 --> 01:33:44,706
Yeah, I'm on it, pal.
You just hurry.

1098
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:48,972
Clear the bridge, escort the
officers down to the hangar.

1099
01:33:48,996 --> 01:33:50,509
Commander...
Captain Dameron,

1100
01:33:50,596 --> 01:33:52,473
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

1101
01:33:52,636 --> 01:33:53,785
Yeah, we spoke.

1102
01:33:55,236 --> 01:33:57,466
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

1103
01:33:57,636 --> 01:33:59,467
Good instinct, Threepio.
Go with that.

1104
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:13,236
Seal that door!

1105
01:34:16,036 --> 01:34:17,076
We're running out of time.

1106
01:34:17,156 --> 01:34:18,384
Come on, how's it going?

1107
01:34:18,556 --> 01:34:20,114
Almost there.

1108
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,987
Threepio, where do you think
you're going?

1109
01:34:23,156 --> 01:34:25,147
It would be quite against
my programming

1110
01:34:25,316 --> 01:34:27,034
- to be party to a mutiny.
- Hey!

1111
01:34:27,196 --> 01:34:29,027
It is not correct protocol.

1112
01:34:29,796 --> 01:34:32,310
Oh! Neither is this!

1113
01:34:32,396 --> 01:34:34,352
Finn? We're ready to make the jump!

1114
01:34:34,556 --> 01:34:35,784
Now or never.

1115
01:34:39,356 --> 01:34:40,755
Now.

1116
01:34:47,796 --> 01:34:48,796
You're up.

1117
01:35:06,596 --> 01:35:08,852
- You there, hands up!
- Watch 'em, watch 'em.

1118
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:10,972
- Drop your weapons, now!
- Hands up, Rebel scum.

1119
01:35:10,996 --> 01:35:12,668
Get down! I said, down!

1120
01:35:22,436 --> 01:35:24,233
FN-2187.

1121
01:35:26,116 --> 01:35:28,471
So good to have you back.

1122
01:35:29,316 --> 01:35:30,431
They didn't make it.

1123
01:35:44,356 --> 01:35:45,471
Leia.

1124
01:35:56,956 --> 01:35:58,412
Please board the transports

1125
01:35:58,436 --> 01:36:00,711
according to your
evacuation designation.

1126
01:36:00,876 --> 01:36:01,932
All transports must be cleared...

1127
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:03,492
Okay,
help me push him up, guys.

1128
01:36:03,516 --> 01:36:04,995
That one's a troublemaker.

1129
01:36:05,636 --> 01:36:06,864
I like him.

1130
01:36:07,596 --> 01:36:08,631
Me, too.

1131
01:36:09,356 --> 01:36:11,347
Now, time to board your transport.

1132
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:14,154
For the transports to escape,

1133
01:36:15,156 --> 01:36:18,114
someone needs to stay behind
and pilot the cruiser.

1134
01:36:22,716 --> 01:36:24,274
Too many losses.

1135
01:36:25,956 --> 01:36:28,072
I can't take any more.

1136
01:36:28,436 --> 01:36:29,710
Sure you can.

1137
01:36:31,116 --> 01:36:33,152
You taught me how.

1138
01:36:35,596 --> 01:36:36,870
May the Force be...

1139
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:40,634
You go on.
I've said it enough.

1140
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:45,866
May the Force be with you always.

1141
01:36:52,596 --> 01:36:53,932
Cloaking device activated.

1142
01:36:53,956 --> 01:36:55,787
We should be off their scopes.

1143
01:36:55,956 --> 01:36:58,345
Let's hope this works.

1144
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,271
Come closer, child.

1145
01:37:20,076 --> 01:37:22,590
So much strength.

1146
01:37:22,956 --> 01:37:26,028
Darkness rises,

1147
01:37:26,236 --> 01:37:29,945
and light to meet it.

1148
01:37:30,876 --> 01:37:34,789
I warned my young apprentice
that as he grew stronger,

1149
01:37:35,116 --> 01:37:37,676
his equal in the light would rise.

1150
01:37:40,276 --> 01:37:41,345
Skywalker...

1151
01:37:41,436 --> 01:37:43,267
I assumed.

1152
01:37:44,356 --> 01:37:45,356
Wrongly.

1153
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:50,393
Closer, I said.

1154
01:37:57,196 --> 01:37:58,948
You underestimate Skywalker,

1155
01:37:59,676 --> 01:38:00,791
and Ben Solo,

1156
01:38:01,476 --> 01:38:02,750
and me.

1157
01:38:03,356 --> 01:38:05,267
It will be your downfall.

1158
01:38:05,396 --> 01:38:06,545
Oh...

1159
01:38:06,916 --> 01:38:08,827
Have you seen something?

1160
01:38:09,276 --> 01:38:12,234
A weakness in my apprentice.

1161
01:38:12,396 --> 01:38:14,387
Is that why you came?

1162
01:38:17,156 --> 01:38:18,828
Young fool.

1163
01:38:19,036 --> 01:38:22,711
It was I who bridged your minds.

1164
01:38:23,156 --> 01:38:26,512
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

1165
01:38:26,676 --> 01:38:29,793
I knew he was not strong enough
to hide it from you.

1166
01:38:29,956 --> 01:38:35,189
And you were not wise enough
to resist the bait.

1167
01:38:38,756 --> 01:38:40,075
And now,

1168
01:38:40,636 --> 01:38:45,471
you will give me Skywalker.

1169
01:38:46,676 --> 01:38:49,110
Then I will kill you

1170
01:38:49,316 --> 01:38:51,989
with the cruelest stroke.

1171
01:38:52,836 --> 01:38:53,836
No.

1172
01:38:54,476 --> 01:38:55,704
Yes.

1173
01:38:59,756 --> 01:39:02,429
Give me

1174
01:39:03,756 --> 01:39:05,474
everything.

1175
01:39:06,036 --> 01:39:07,708
No! No!

1176
01:39:08,196 --> 01:39:09,231
No!

1177
01:39:16,316 --> 01:39:17,954
No. No.

1178
01:39:18,116 --> 01:39:19,310
No, no, no!

1179
01:39:24,236 --> 01:39:25,305
Poe.

1180
01:39:31,036 --> 01:39:32,036
What is that?

1181
01:39:32,196 --> 01:39:33,993
The mineral planet, Crait.

1182
01:39:34,156 --> 01:39:36,511
An uncharted hideout from
the days of the Rebellion.

1183
01:39:37,036 --> 01:39:38,913
- That's a Rebel base?
- Abandoned,

1184
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:40,396
but heavily armored

1185
01:39:40,556 --> 01:39:41,556
with enough power

1186
01:39:41,636 --> 01:39:43,012
to get a distress signal to our allies

1187
01:39:43,036 --> 01:39:44,185
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1188
01:39:44,356 --> 01:39:46,153
Holdo knew the First Order

1189
01:39:46,316 --> 01:39:47,465
was tracking our big ship.

1190
01:39:47,636 --> 01:39:50,469
They're not monitoring
for little transports.

1191
01:39:50,996 --> 01:39:53,191
So we could slip down
to the surface unnoticed

1192
01:39:53,356 --> 01:39:56,632
and hide till the First Order passes.

1193
01:39:58,796 --> 01:39:59,865
That could work.

1194
01:40:01,516 --> 01:40:03,472
She was more interested

1195
01:40:03,596 --> 01:40:05,951
in protecting the light than she was

1196
01:40:06,516 --> 01:40:08,984
seeming like a hero.

1197
01:40:20,956 --> 01:40:22,230
Godspeed,

1198
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:23,949
Rebels.

1199
01:40:53,676 --> 01:40:55,029
Well done, Phasma.

1200
01:40:56,156 --> 01:40:58,909
Your ship and payment, as we agreed.

1201
01:41:06,796 --> 01:41:08,388
You lying snake.

1202
01:41:13,236 --> 01:41:15,511
We got caught,

1203
01:41:16,196 --> 01:41:18,266
I cut a d-d-deal.

1204
01:41:19,076 --> 01:41:20,111
Wait,

1205
01:41:20,796 --> 01:41:22,115
cut a deal with what?

1206
01:41:22,276 --> 01:41:24,236
Sir, we checked on the
information from the thief.

1207
01:41:24,396 --> 01:41:26,830
We ran a decloaking scan,
and sure enough,

1208
01:41:26,996 --> 01:41:29,396
30 Resistance transports
have just launched from the cruiser.

1209
01:41:30,516 --> 01:41:32,666
He told us the truth.

1210
01:41:33,476 --> 01:41:35,148
Will wonders never cease?

1211
01:41:35,356 --> 01:41:36,356
No.

1212
01:41:36,796 --> 01:41:37,796
Our weapons are ready?

1213
01:41:37,956 --> 01:41:39,309
Ready and aimed, sir.

1214
01:41:40,156 --> 01:41:41,794
Fire at will.

1215
01:41:42,516 --> 01:41:44,029
Wait. No, no.
No, you can't!

1216
01:41:44,596 --> 01:41:45,949
No!

1217
01:42:00,116 --> 01:42:01,708
Admiral, we're taking fire!

1218
01:42:01,876 --> 01:42:03,452
- Do we turn around?
- No, you're too far out.

1219
01:42:03,476 --> 01:42:05,114
Full speed to planetfall.

1220
01:42:05,276 --> 01:42:06,276
Full speed!

1221
01:42:12,076 --> 01:42:14,112
Well, well,

1222
01:42:14,196 --> 01:42:17,950
I did not expect Skywalker
to be so wise.

1223
01:42:18,556 --> 01:42:21,116
We will give him and the Jedi Order

1224
01:42:21,316 --> 01:42:23,671
the death he desires.

1225
01:42:24,316 --> 01:42:25,544
After the Rebels are gone,

1226
01:42:25,716 --> 01:42:27,195
we will go to his planet

1227
01:42:27,356 --> 01:42:31,190
and obliterate the entire island.

1228
01:42:37,996 --> 01:42:39,395
Such spunk.

1229
01:42:40,076 --> 01:42:41,191
Look here now.

1230
01:42:48,636 --> 01:42:53,664
The entire Resistance
on those transports...

1231
01:42:54,316 --> 01:42:58,025
Soon they will all be gone.

1232
01:42:58,396 --> 01:43:01,513
For you, all is lost.

1233
01:43:05,556 --> 01:43:09,549
Ooh. And still that
fiery spit of hope.

1234
01:43:11,196 --> 01:43:14,347
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

1235
01:43:22,836 --> 01:43:24,155
And because of that,

1236
01:43:25,276 --> 01:43:26,675
you must die.

1237
01:43:29,476 --> 01:43:31,626
My worthy apprentice,

1238
01:43:31,796 --> 01:43:35,550
son of darkness,
heir apparent to Lord Vader.

1239
01:43:35,716 --> 01:43:39,152
Where there was conflict,
I now sense resolve.

1240
01:43:39,356 --> 01:43:42,029
Where there was weakness, strength.

1241
01:43:42,836 --> 01:43:44,428
Complete your training,

1242
01:43:44,756 --> 01:43:49,147
and fulfill your destiny.

1243
01:43:58,396 --> 01:44:00,068
I know what I have to do.

1244
01:44:02,116 --> 01:44:03,231
Ben.

1245
01:44:04,916 --> 01:44:07,111
You think you can turn him?

1246
01:44:07,676 --> 01:44:09,473
Pathetic child.

1247
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:13,425
I cannot be betrayed,

1248
01:44:13,636 --> 01:44:15,672
I cannot be beaten.

1249
01:44:15,836 --> 01:44:18,191
I see his mind,

1250
01:44:18,356 --> 01:44:21,428
I see his every intent.

1251
01:44:21,516 --> 01:44:22,516
Yes.

1252
01:44:24,036 --> 01:44:29,713
I see him turning
the lightsaber to strike true.

1253
01:44:30,276 --> 01:44:31,345
And now,

1254
01:44:32,156 --> 01:44:34,033
foolish child,

1255
01:44:34,196 --> 01:44:36,152
he ignites it,

1256
01:44:36,796 --> 01:44:40,345
and kills his true enemy!

1257
01:45:21,476 --> 01:45:23,196
Come on, give it full thrusters.
Full speed!

1258
01:45:23,356 --> 01:45:24,755
I am, sir.

1259
01:45:27,436 --> 01:45:28,949
You murdering bastard!

1260
01:45:29,596 --> 01:45:31,746
T-T-Take it easy, Big F.

1261
01:45:32,196 --> 01:45:35,029
They blow you up today,
you blow them up tomorrow.

1262
01:45:35,756 --> 01:45:37,394
It's just business.

1263
01:45:39,956 --> 01:45:41,150
You're wrong.

1264
01:45:44,836 --> 01:45:45,871
Maybe.

1265
01:47:29,356 --> 01:47:30,356
Ben!

1266
01:47:42,636 --> 01:47:43,785
The fleet.

1267
01:47:43,956 --> 01:47:44,996
Order them to stop firing.

1268
01:47:45,116 --> 01:47:46,913
There's still time to save the fleet.

1269
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:56,705
Ben?

1270
01:47:58,916 --> 01:48:00,872
It's time to let old things die.

1271
01:48:03,436 --> 01:48:04,710
Snoke,

1272
01:48:04,876 --> 01:48:06,150
Skywalker.

1273
01:48:08,196 --> 01:48:09,549
The Sith,

1274
01:48:10,236 --> 01:48:12,067
the Jedi, the Rebels...

1275
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:13,589
Let it all die.

1276
01:48:14,236 --> 01:48:15,271
Rey.

1277
01:48:17,316 --> 01:48:18,795
I want you to join me.

1278
01:48:20,756 --> 01:48:23,316
We can rule together
and bring a new order to the galaxy.

1279
01:48:23,476 --> 01:48:24,875
Don't do this, Ben.

1280
01:48:26,036 --> 01:48:27,105
Please don't go this way.

1281
01:48:27,276 --> 01:48:30,746
No, no. You're still
holding on! Let go!

1282
01:48:31,916 --> 01:48:34,191
Do you wanna know the truth
about your parents?

1283
01:48:35,196 --> 01:48:36,595
Or have you always known?

1284
01:48:39,196 --> 01:48:40,754
And you've just hidden it away.

1285
01:48:42,796 --> 01:48:44,309
You know the truth.

1286
01:48:45,156 --> 01:48:46,589
Say it.

1287
01:48:49,716 --> 01:48:50,944
Say it.

1288
01:48:52,956 --> 01:48:54,469
They were nobody.

1289
01:48:54,636 --> 01:48:56,274
They were filthy junk traders

1290
01:48:56,436 --> 01:48:58,347
who sold you off for drinking money.

1291
01:49:00,396 --> 01:49:03,513
They're dead in a paupers'
grave in the Jakku desert.

1292
01:49:04,276 --> 01:49:06,232
You have no place in this story.

1293
01:49:06,396 --> 01:49:08,387
You come from nothing.
You're nothing.

1294
01:49:12,716 --> 01:49:13,990
But not to me.

1295
01:49:18,076 --> 01:49:19,076
Join me.

1296
01:49:32,556 --> 01:49:33,591
Please.

1297
01:50:03,996 --> 01:50:04,996
Sir,

1298
01:50:05,596 --> 01:50:08,349
the Resistance cruiser's
preparing to jump to lightspeed.

1299
01:50:09,156 --> 01:50:10,225
It's empty.

1300
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:12,236
They're just trying
to pull our attention away.

1301
01:50:12,676 --> 01:50:13,825
Pathetic.

1302
01:50:14,036 --> 01:50:16,186
Keep your fire on the transports.

1303
01:50:44,036 --> 01:50:46,755
Execution by blaster
is too good for them.

1304
01:50:46,916 --> 01:50:48,952
Let's make this hurt.

1305
01:50:54,676 --> 01:50:55,676
Finn.

1306
01:51:00,316 --> 01:51:01,908
On my command.

1307
01:51:06,716 --> 01:51:07,990
She's running away.

1308
01:51:10,116 --> 01:51:11,265
No, she isn't.

1309
01:51:25,196 --> 01:51:28,154
- No!
- Fire on that cruiser!

1310
01:51:41,996 --> 01:51:42,996
Execute.

1311
01:52:27,116 --> 01:52:28,185
Finn!

1312
01:52:28,356 --> 01:52:31,234
There's a shuttle back that way!
We gotta go!

1313
01:52:46,636 --> 01:52:48,069
Traitor!

1314
01:52:49,756 --> 01:52:50,756
What?

1315
01:53:14,076 --> 01:53:15,076
Finn!

1316
01:53:34,476 --> 01:53:36,228
You are a bug in the system.

1317
01:53:36,596 --> 01:53:37,790
Let's go, chrome dome.

1318
01:53:45,476 --> 01:53:46,591
Come on!

1319
01:53:56,276 --> 01:53:57,276
No!

1320
01:54:03,236 --> 01:54:04,236
Hey.

1321
01:54:20,196 --> 01:54:22,835
You were always scum.

1322
01:54:24,396 --> 01:54:25,909
Rebel scum.

1323
01:54:39,396 --> 01:54:41,626
Hey! Need a lift?

1324
01:55:19,396 --> 01:55:21,512
What happened?

1325
01:55:22,116 --> 01:55:23,788
The girl murdered Snoke.

1326
01:55:28,236 --> 01:55:29,589
What happened?

1327
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:32,316
She took Snoke's escape craft.

1328
01:55:32,716 --> 01:55:34,115
We know where she's going.

1329
01:55:35,116 --> 01:55:36,996
Get all our forces down
to that Resistance base.

1330
01:55:37,316 --> 01:55:38,749
Let's finish this.

1331
01:55:39,556 --> 01:55:40,705
Finish this?

1332
01:55:41,316 --> 01:55:43,386
Who do you think you're talking to?

1333
01:55:43,836 --> 01:55:46,350
You presume to command my army?

1334
01:55:47,116 --> 01:55:50,472
Our Supreme Leader is dead!
We have no ruler!

1335
01:55:54,996 --> 01:55:58,306
The Supreme Leader is dead.

1336
01:56:00,276 --> 01:56:03,393
Long live the Supreme Leader.

1337
01:56:21,236 --> 01:56:23,386
They're coming, shut the door.

1338
01:56:31,156 --> 01:56:32,828
Incoming!

1339
01:56:36,436 --> 01:56:38,313
Go! Go! Move!

1340
01:56:39,276 --> 01:56:41,232
Get that shield door down!

1341
01:56:57,076 --> 01:56:58,452
No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us!

1342
01:56:58,476 --> 01:56:59,511
No! Don't shoot!

1343
01:56:59,676 --> 01:57:00,676
Hold your fire!

1344
01:57:00,836 --> 01:57:02,872
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

1345
01:57:05,436 --> 01:57:06,664
- Finn?
- Finn!

1346
01:57:07,236 --> 01:57:08,874
Rose! You're not dead!

1347
01:57:09,076 --> 01:57:10,270
Where's my droid?

1348
01:57:11,556 --> 01:57:12,591
Buddy!

1349
01:57:12,756 --> 01:57:15,270
I'm so glad to see you!

1350
01:57:16,676 --> 01:57:18,826
Wait, what?
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

1351
01:57:18,996 --> 01:57:20,270
Is this all that's left?

1352
01:57:30,636 --> 01:57:32,917
All right, shields are up
so they can't hit us from orbit.

1353
01:57:33,156 --> 01:57:34,476
Use whatever power we've got left

1354
01:57:34,556 --> 01:57:36,592
to broadcast a distress signal
to the Outer Rim.

1355
01:57:36,756 --> 01:57:38,428
Use my personal code.

1356
01:57:38,916 --> 01:57:41,749
If there are any allies to the Resistance,

1357
01:57:42,316 --> 01:57:43,431
it's now or never.

1358
01:57:44,156 --> 01:57:46,067
Rose, what do you got?

1359
01:57:46,556 --> 01:57:50,151
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery,
some half-gutted skim speeders.

1360
01:57:50,316 --> 01:57:51,316
Well,

1361
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:53,749
let's just pray that big-ass door

1362
01:57:53,876 --> 01:57:56,151
holds long enough for us
to get help.

1363
01:58:06,436 --> 01:58:08,233
A battering ram cannon.

1364
01:58:08,396 --> 01:58:10,034
A what now?

1365
01:58:10,476 --> 01:58:11,875
Miniaturized Death Star tech.

1366
01:58:12,036 --> 01:58:13,788
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

1367
01:58:14,556 --> 01:58:16,356
There has to be a back way
out of here, right?

1368
01:58:17,516 --> 01:58:19,313
BB-8, what do you got?

1369
01:58:20,116 --> 01:58:23,313
BB-8 has analyzed
the mine's schematics.

1370
01:58:23,476 --> 01:58:26,593
This is the only way in or out.

1371
01:58:33,956 --> 01:58:34,956
Come on.

1372
01:58:35,956 --> 01:58:37,184
We have allies.

1373
01:58:37,436 --> 01:58:39,267
People believe in Leia.

1374
01:58:39,956 --> 01:58:41,514
They'll get our message, they'll come.

1375
01:58:42,076 --> 01:58:44,306
But we have to buy time.

1376
01:58:45,276 --> 01:58:47,949
We gotta take out that cannon.

1377
01:58:52,236 --> 01:58:53,236
On me! On me!

1378
01:58:54,436 --> 01:58:55,436
Move! Move!

1379
01:58:55,756 --> 01:58:57,109
Go back! Gather your weapons!

1380
01:58:57,276 --> 01:58:58,709
Get over here!

1381
01:58:58,876 --> 01:58:59,916
Hold your fire!

1382
01:59:17,156 --> 01:59:18,156
Salt.

1383
01:59:18,316 --> 01:59:19,716
Ground forces, incoming.

1384
01:59:19,756 --> 01:59:21,428
Copy that. On our way.

1385
01:59:38,836 --> 01:59:39,985
Engage your mono-ski.

1386
01:59:40,156 --> 01:59:41,714
The green toggle.

1387
01:59:51,756 --> 01:59:52,905
All right, listen up.

1388
01:59:53,116 --> 01:59:56,233
I don't like these rust buckets
and I don't like our odds, but...

1389
01:59:56,716 --> 01:59:58,035
What the hell?

1390
01:59:58,196 --> 01:59:59,470
Just keep it tight

1391
01:59:59,636 --> 02:00:02,594
and don't get drawn in too close
till they roll that cannon out front.

1392
02:00:22,476 --> 02:00:24,706
All right, ground forces,
lay down some fire!

1393
02:00:37,756 --> 02:00:39,633
Thirteen incoming light craft.

1394
02:00:39,796 --> 02:00:41,707
Shall we hold until we clear them?

1395
02:00:41,916 --> 02:00:44,794
No. The Resistance
is in that mine.

1396
02:00:45,316 --> 02:00:46,465
Push through.

1397
02:00:51,316 --> 02:00:52,829
Fighters, break off!

1398
02:01:02,916 --> 02:01:05,794
Come on! We gotta hold them
till they pull up that cannon!

1399
02:01:21,236 --> 02:01:23,272
Rose, you got three right behind you!

1400
02:01:31,156 --> 02:01:32,156
I can't lose 'em!

1401
02:01:39,276 --> 02:01:40,948
Whoo! Yeah!

1402
02:01:53,996 --> 02:01:55,952
Whoo! I like this!

1403
02:02:04,556 --> 02:02:07,628
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!

1404
02:02:07,836 --> 02:02:09,189
All fighters!

1405
02:02:16,356 --> 02:02:18,028
Chewie, peel off from the battle.

1406
02:02:18,196 --> 02:02:19,549
Draw them away from the speeders.

1407
02:02:25,356 --> 02:02:26,994
She drew 'em off! All of 'em!

1408
02:02:27,156 --> 02:02:28,748
Oh, they hate that ship!

1409
02:02:41,356 --> 02:02:42,356
Chewie!

1410
02:03:13,716 --> 02:03:14,716
There it is!

1411
02:03:19,916 --> 02:03:21,031
That is a big gun.

1412
02:03:21,196 --> 02:03:22,516
Okay, it's heavily armored.

1413
02:03:22,636 --> 02:03:24,627
Our only shot is right down the throat.

1414
02:03:32,436 --> 02:03:34,188
The cannon's opening.
This is our chance.

1415
02:03:34,356 --> 02:03:35,636
All firepower on those speeders.

1416
02:03:35,716 --> 02:03:38,150
Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

1417
02:03:45,036 --> 02:03:46,469
We're taking heavy losses.

1418
02:03:58,876 --> 02:04:00,892
They're picking us all off.
We're not gonna make it.

1419
02:04:00,916 --> 02:04:02,634
All right,
making my final approach.

1420
02:04:02,796 --> 02:04:04,195
Target in sight, guns are hot.

1421
02:04:04,356 --> 02:04:05,584
No! Pull off!

1422
02:04:05,756 --> 02:04:06,791
What?

1423
02:04:06,996 --> 02:04:08,532
The cannon is charged!
It's a suicide run!

1424
02:04:08,556 --> 02:04:09,909
All craft, pull away!

1425
02:04:10,076 --> 02:04:12,146
- No! I'm almost there!
- Retreat, Finn!

1426
02:04:12,316 --> 02:04:13,544
That's an order!

1427
02:04:22,556 --> 02:04:24,706
Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!

1428
02:04:24,876 --> 02:04:26,867
No! I won't let them win!

1429
02:04:28,916 --> 02:04:30,872
No! Finn, listen to Poe!

1430
02:04:31,036 --> 02:04:32,469
We have to retreat!

1431
02:04:44,516 --> 02:04:46,950
The cannon is warming up now.

1432
02:04:47,116 --> 02:04:48,452
Copy that. We see it.

1433
02:04:48,476 --> 02:04:50,228
Preparing to fire.

1434
02:05:32,036 --> 02:05:33,867
Move! Go, go! Quick!

1435
02:05:34,036 --> 02:05:35,708
Let's go, let's go!

1436
02:05:42,116 --> 02:05:43,310
Rose?

1437
02:05:48,956 --> 02:05:50,071
Rose?

1438
02:05:50,476 --> 02:05:51,875
Rose?

1439
02:05:52,796 --> 02:05:54,627
Why would you do that? Huh?

1440
02:05:54,716 --> 02:05:56,593
I was almost there.

1441
02:05:57,396 --> 02:05:58,875
Why would you stop me?

1442
02:05:59,636 --> 02:06:01,752
I saved you,

1443
02:06:02,796 --> 02:06:03,796
dummy.

1444
02:06:04,916 --> 02:06:06,588
That's how we're gonna win.

1445
02:06:06,756 --> 02:06:09,145
Not fighting what we hate,

1446
02:06:09,596 --> 02:06:11,951
saving what we love.

1447
02:06:31,396 --> 02:06:32,749
General Hux,

1448
02:06:32,916 --> 02:06:34,474
advance.

1449
02:06:34,916 --> 02:06:36,508
No quarter.

1450
02:06:37,916 --> 02:06:39,474
No prisoners.

1451
02:06:41,236 --> 02:06:44,467
Our distress signal's been
received at multiple points,

1452
02:06:44,636 --> 02:06:46,706
but no response.

1453
02:06:47,276 --> 02:06:49,028
They've heard us,

1454
02:06:49,396 --> 02:06:51,512
but no one's coming.

1455
02:06:55,876 --> 02:06:58,026
We fought till the end.

1456
02:07:00,356 --> 02:07:05,305
But the galaxy has lost all its hope.

1457
02:07:06,676 --> 02:07:08,109
The spark

1458
02:07:10,036 --> 02:07:11,515
is out.

1459
02:07:37,116 --> 02:07:38,674
Luke.

1460
02:07:47,116 --> 02:07:49,710
I know what you're gonna say.

1461
02:07:50,916 --> 02:07:52,747
I changed my hair.

1462
02:07:54,756 --> 02:07:56,428
It's nice that way.

1463
02:07:58,276 --> 02:07:59,914
Leia,

1464
02:08:01,076 --> 02:08:02,076
I'm sorry.

1465
02:08:02,276 --> 02:08:04,107
I know.

1466
02:08:04,316 --> 02:08:06,511
I know you are.

1467
02:08:07,316 --> 02:08:09,272
I'm just glad you're here

1468
02:08:10,196 --> 02:08:11,754
at the end.

1469
02:08:13,156 --> 02:08:14,987
I came to face him, Leia.

1470
02:08:16,996 --> 02:08:19,226
And I can't save him.

1471
02:08:19,596 --> 02:08:22,872
I held out hope for so long,

1472
02:08:25,636 --> 02:08:28,196
but I know my son is gone.

1473
02:08:29,076 --> 02:08:31,795
No one's ever really gone.

1474
02:09:07,396 --> 02:09:09,227
Master Luke.

1475
02:09:32,276 --> 02:09:33,276
Stop!

1476
02:09:58,916 --> 02:10:02,431
I want every gun we have
to fire on that man.

1477
02:10:07,596 --> 02:10:09,075
Do it.

1478
02:10:25,716 --> 02:10:26,831
More!

1479
02:10:30,116 --> 02:10:31,116
More!

1480
02:10:45,676 --> 02:10:47,314
That's enough.

1481
02:10:48,756 --> 02:10:50,951
That's enough!

1482
02:10:56,876 --> 02:10:58,514
Do you think you got him?

1483
02:10:59,836 --> 02:11:01,667
Now, if we're ready to get moving,

1484
02:11:01,836 --> 02:11:04,031
we can finish this.

1485
02:11:04,196 --> 02:11:05,311
Sir?

1486
02:11:31,796 --> 02:11:33,115
Bring me down to him.

1487
02:11:33,476 --> 02:11:36,309
Keep the door covered
and don't advance until I say.

1488
02:11:36,396 --> 02:11:37,396
Supreme Leader,

1489
02:11:37,836 --> 02:11:39,349
don't get distracted, our goal...

1490
02:11:41,836 --> 02:11:43,064
Right away, sir.

1491
02:11:44,196 --> 02:11:45,709
Med pack!

1492
02:11:45,916 --> 02:11:47,952
I need a med pack!

1493
02:11:48,156 --> 02:11:50,192
She's hurt pretty bad.

1494
02:12:08,956 --> 02:12:10,230
It's Kylo Ren.

1495
02:12:10,436 --> 02:12:11,630
Luke's facing him alone.

1496
02:12:11,796 --> 02:12:13,196
Well, we should help him.
Let's go.

1497
02:12:13,356 --> 02:12:15,028
No, wait. Wait.

1498
02:12:28,996 --> 02:12:31,351
Did you come back to say you forgive me?

1499
02:12:32,356 --> 02:12:34,233
To save my soul?

1500
02:12:35,996 --> 02:12:37,588
No.

1501
02:12:56,476 --> 02:12:58,706
He's doing this for a reason.

1502
02:13:00,556 --> 02:13:02,308
He's stalling so we can escape.

1503
02:13:02,396 --> 02:13:03,396
Escape?

1504
02:13:03,476 --> 02:13:04,612
He's one man against an army.

1505
02:13:04,636 --> 02:13:06,149
We have to help him,
we have to fight.

1506
02:13:06,316 --> 02:13:08,511
No, no. We are the spark
that'll light the fire

1507
02:13:08,596 --> 02:13:10,188
that'll burn the First Order down.

1508
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:14,388
Skywalker's doing this
so we can survive.

1509
02:13:14,556 --> 02:13:16,092
There's gotta be a way
out of this mine.

1510
02:13:16,116 --> 02:13:17,276
Hell, how did he get in here?

1511
02:13:17,436 --> 02:13:21,475
Sir, it is possible that
a natural unmapped opening exists.

1512
02:13:21,676 --> 02:13:24,634
But this facility is such
a maze of endless tunnels

1513
02:13:24,796 --> 02:13:26,514
that the odds of finding an exit

1514
02:13:26,596 --> 02:13:29,269
- are 15,428...
- Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up.

1515
02:13:29,356 --> 02:13:30,914
Shut up!

1516
02:13:32,116 --> 02:13:33,834
- To one.
- Listen.

1517
02:13:36,516 --> 02:13:38,746
My audio sensors
no longer detect the...

1518
02:13:38,916 --> 02:13:39,985
Exactly.

1519
02:13:45,876 --> 02:13:48,595
Where'd the crystal critters go?

1520
02:13:54,276 --> 02:13:55,276
Follow me.

1521
02:13:59,836 --> 02:14:01,792
What are you looking at me for?

1522
02:14:01,956 --> 02:14:03,435
Follow him.

1523
02:14:15,076 --> 02:14:17,544
If the beacon's right beneath us,
they've got to be somewhere.

1524
02:14:17,716 --> 02:14:19,229
Keep scanning for life forms.

1525
02:14:29,036 --> 02:14:30,549
This way.

1526
02:14:35,116 --> 02:14:36,754
I see them! Chewie, there!

1527
02:14:50,436 --> 02:14:53,314
No. No, no, no.

1528
02:14:56,716 --> 02:14:57,716
No!

1529
02:15:09,956 --> 02:15:11,787
Lifting rocks.

1530
02:15:51,876 --> 02:15:54,390
I failed you, Ben.

1531
02:15:55,236 --> 02:15:57,591
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure you are!

1532
02:15:58,756 --> 02:16:00,826
The Resistance is dead.

1533
02:16:00,996 --> 02:16:02,554
The war is over.

1534
02:16:02,756 --> 02:16:04,747
And when I kill you,

1535
02:16:04,916 --> 02:16:07,350
I will have killed the last Jedi.

1536
02:16:07,516 --> 02:16:08,631
Amazing.

1537
02:16:09,196 --> 02:16:12,950
Every word of what you just said
was wrong.

1538
02:16:15,316 --> 02:16:18,433
The Rebellion is reborn today.

1539
02:16:20,636 --> 02:16:22,627
The war

1540
02:16:22,796 --> 02:16:24,468
is just beginning.

1541
02:16:25,676 --> 02:16:29,555
And I will not be the last Jedi.

1542
02:17:09,356 --> 02:17:11,392
I'll destroy her,

1543
02:17:11,556 --> 02:17:13,592
and you,

1544
02:17:13,756 --> 02:17:15,394
and all of it.

1545
02:17:19,236 --> 02:17:20,236
No.

1546
02:17:21,356 --> 02:17:24,587
Strike me down in anger
and I'll always be with you.

1547
02:17:27,236 --> 02:17:29,306
Just like your father.

1548
02:18:18,756 --> 02:18:19,756
No.

1549
02:18:24,076 --> 02:18:26,192
See you around, kid.

1550
02:18:39,876 --> 02:18:41,275
No!

1551
02:21:18,716 --> 02:21:20,752
C'ai!

1552
02:21:20,836 --> 02:21:22,792
Such a friend.

1553
02:21:23,156 --> 02:21:24,874
Chewie!

1554
02:21:26,196 --> 02:21:27,948
It looks good.

1555
02:21:28,396 --> 02:21:29,545
That was crazy, man.

1556
02:21:30,996 --> 02:21:32,475
- Hi.
- Hi.

1557
02:21:33,076 --> 02:21:34,111
I'm Poe.

1558
02:21:34,956 --> 02:21:35,956
Rey.

1559
02:21:36,316 --> 02:21:37,351
I know.

1560
02:21:49,676 --> 02:21:51,732
When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

1561
02:21:51,756 --> 02:21:53,076
Quite definitely possible.

1562
02:22:03,476 --> 02:22:04,955
Luke is gone.

1563
02:22:05,836 --> 02:22:07,235
I felt it.

1564
02:22:07,836 --> 02:22:09,667
But it wasn't sadness or pain.

1565
02:22:10,956 --> 02:22:13,265
It was peace and purpose.

1566
02:22:14,236 --> 02:22:15,555
I felt it, too.

1567
02:22:18,236 --> 02:22:21,148
How do we build a Rebellion from this?

1568
02:22:25,596 --> 02:22:28,315
We have everything we need.

1569
02:22:47,956 --> 02:22:49,753
Luke Skywalker,

1570
02:22:49,916 --> 02:22:51,713
Jedi Master.
