1
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,360
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,400
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,240
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,660
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,950
Stand by.

6
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,330
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,750
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,860
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,070
Sir.

10
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,940
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honored.

11
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,360
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,990
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,160
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,700
Perhaps I can find new ways
to motivate them.

15
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,090
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,430
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,680
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,430
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,360
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,900
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,320
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,370
The emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,720
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,640
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,060
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,480
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,480
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
R2, are you sure this is the right place?

30
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,300
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,090
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,560
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,250
I don't think they're going
to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,960
We'd better go.

35
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,470
R2, wait.

36
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,940
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,900
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,780
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,450
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,540
Oh, my!

42
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,630
Oh, no.

43
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,090
Oh, my.

44
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,980
We bring a message
to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,940
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,400
What gift?

47
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,170
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,730
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,570
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:21,120
" FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun! "

51
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,270
Good morning.

52
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,780
The message, R2. The message.

53
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,460
" Greetings, Exalted One. "

54
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,870
" Allow me to introduce myself. "

55
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,920
" I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo. "

56
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,340
" I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba... "

57
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,140
" and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful. "

58
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,100
" I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life. "

59
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,480
" With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement... "

60
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,310
" which will be mutually beneficial... "

61
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,150
" and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation. "

62
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,410
" As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift... "

63
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,280
" these two droids. "

64
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,290
What did he say?

65
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,960
" Both are hardworking
and will serve you well. "

66
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,830
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

67
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,220
He's no Jedi.

68
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,680
There will be no bargain.

69
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,020
We're doomed.

70
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:13,110
I will not give up my favorite decoration.

71
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,530
I like Captain Solo where he is.

72
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,830
R2, look. Captain Solo.

73
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,500
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

74
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,090
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

75
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,100
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

76
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,600
How horrid!

77
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,010
Good. New acquisitions.

78
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,760
You are a protocol droid, are you not?

79
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,800
I am C-3PO...

80
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,680
Yes or no will do.

81
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,310
Well, yes.

82
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,940
How many languages do you speak?

83
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,690
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...

84
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,440
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

85
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,900
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

86
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,820
and disintegrated him.

87
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,530
Disintegrated?

88
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,250
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

89
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,540
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

90
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,010
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

91
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,590
R2, don't leave me!

92
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,890
You're a feisty little one...

93
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,480
but you'll soon learn some respect.

94
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,900
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

95
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,730
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

96
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,890
Ah! Do that again!

97
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,300
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

98
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,630
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

99
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,980
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

100
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,570
Yes, I am here, Your Worshipfulness.

101
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,030
Yes?

102
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,250
The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome...

103
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,960
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

104
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,050
I want 50,000. No less.

105
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,840
"50,000. No less."

106
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,520
What did I say?

107
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,530
The mighty Jabba asks
why he must pay 50,000.

108
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,830
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.

109
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:18,390
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum,
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,650
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,950
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,120
He agrees!

113
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,710
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,460
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,010
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,600
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,020
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,940
Who are you?

119
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,450
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,950
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,370
What's that?

122
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,000
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,260
Hey, Jabba.

124
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,220
Look, Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,220
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,100
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,940
You may have been a good smuggler,

128
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,490
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,160
Look...

130
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,500
Take him away.

131
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,330
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,960
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,050
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,340
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,510
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,310
I'm sure.

137
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,190
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,210
Chewie?

139
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,550
Wait a minute. I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,510
What's going on?

142
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,640
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,310
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,980
A Jedi knight?

145
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,730
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,070
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,490
I'm all right.

148
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,460
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,640
No bargain.

150
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,220
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,480
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,360
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,500
At last!
Master Luke's come to rescue me.

154
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,910
Master.

155
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,210
Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.

156
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,630
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,510
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,390
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,180
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,560
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,190
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,330
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,580
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,670
I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends.

165
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,630
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,720
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,050
Master Luke, you're standing on...

168
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,770
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,440
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,220
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,230
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,570
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,450
Han.

174
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,170
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,710
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

176
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,510
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,140
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,220
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,190
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,360
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,150
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,110
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,570
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,990
nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,330
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,330
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,540
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,260
On second thought, let's pass on that.

189
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,970
You should have bargained, Jabba.

190
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,220
That's the last mistake you'll ever make.

191
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,480
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,740
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,780
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,740
You're gonna die here, you know.
Convenient.

195
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,160
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,620
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,790
Great.

198
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,260
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,470
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,520
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,690
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,770
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,610
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,100
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,350
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honorably.

206
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,850
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,980
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:53,490
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,250
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,160
Right?

211
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,540
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,800
Free us or die.

213
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,010
Move him into position.

214
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,500
Put him in.

215
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,400
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,780
Help!

217
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,750
Chewie, you're hit? Where is it?

218
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,300
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,470
Lando.

220
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,940
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,400
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,560
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,100
I'm trying!

224
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,670
Grab me, Chewie. Grab it!

225
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,640
Grab it. Almost. You almost got it.

226
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,320
Gently, now.

227
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,530
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,790
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,920
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,050
I can see a lot better. Don't move.

231
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,720
A little higher!

232
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,890
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,560
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,020
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,520
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,110
Beast!

238
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,320
Get the gun!

239
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,740
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,790
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,130
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...

242
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,800
Come on.

243
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,310
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,610
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,360
" Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now. "

246
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,150
- I will.
" - Luke, thanks. "

247
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,530
" Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one. "

248
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,660
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,340
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,430
to an old friend.

251
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,060
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,070
The Death Star will be completed
on schedule.

253
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,320
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:55,290
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

255
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,210
Yes, my master.

256
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,590
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,050
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:10,600
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

259
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,020
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,810
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,730
As you wish.

262
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,320
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,640
That face you make...

264
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,230
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,150
No, of course not.

266
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,980
I do.

267
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,070
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,910
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,990
Old and weak.

270
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,580
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,540
look as good you will not.

272
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,550
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,810
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,060
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,850
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,110
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,190
but not that strong.

278
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:56,030
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,670
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,960
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,760
But I need your help.

282
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,050
I've come back to complete the training.

283
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,300
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,560
Already know you that which you need.

285
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,940
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,530
Not yet.

287
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,660
One thing remains...

288
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,120
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:45,080
Then... only then... a Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,920
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,050
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,230
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,860
Rest I need.

294
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,400
Yes.

295
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,980
Rest.

296
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,030
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,580
Your father he is.

298
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,420
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,510
Yes.

300
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,640
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,100
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,890
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,310
No.

304
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,440
Unfortunate that you rushed to face him...

305
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,150
that incomplete was your training...

306
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,700
that not ready for the burden were you.

307
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,330
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,040
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,840
But beware.

310
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,510
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,270
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,730
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,610
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,660
Do not...

315
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,250
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,750
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,340
When gone am I...

318
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,220
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,810
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,900
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,460
There is...

322
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,330
another...

323
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,880
Skywalker.

324
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,570
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,870
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,250
Yoda will always be with you.

327
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,500
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,130
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,140
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:13,770
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:17,820
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,440
When that happened...

333
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,740
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

334
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,240
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,160
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,740
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,750
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,840
depend greatly on our own point of view.

339
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,340
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,840
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,130
your father was already a great pilot...

342
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,890
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:53,980
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,020
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,440
I was wrong.

346
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,280
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,320
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,280
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,200
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,250
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,620
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,590
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,880
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,180
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,600
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,270
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,110
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,150
To protect you both from the emperor...

359
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,860
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

360
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,450
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,290
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

362
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,950
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,380
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,880
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,050
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,560
They do you credit...

367
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,810
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,920
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,130
Someone must have told them about
my maneuver at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:49,130
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,220
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,510
I'm surprised
they didn't ask you to do it.

373
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,310
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,230
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,530
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,200
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies
pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,450
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,370
We also know that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,750
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,840
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,460
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,460
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,670
But most important of all...

384
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,470
we've learned that the emperor himself...

385
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,720
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,350
of the construction of this Death Star.

387
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,650
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,520
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:52,780
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:58,370
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,040
the Death Star does have
a strong defense mechanism.

392
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,580
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,380
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,760
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,060
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,110
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,190
and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

398
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,070
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,490
Good luck.

400
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,080
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,910
General Madine.

402
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,880
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,210
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:56,130
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,510
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,930
Wonder who they found to pull that off.

407
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:03,100
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,150
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,360
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,780
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,820
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,460
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,210
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,800
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,440
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,110
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,660
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,120
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,240
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:07,080
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,790
All right?

422
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,210
Right.

423
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,680
I got your promise. Not a scratch.

424
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,010
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,890
Good luck.

426
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,480
You too.

427
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,610
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,910
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,170
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,760
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,260
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,730
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,060
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,440
Here we go again.

435
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,330
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,140
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,600
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,150
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:04,570
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,700
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,750
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,670
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,460
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,500
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:37,310
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,190
" We have you on our screen now.
Please identify. "

447
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,570
Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

448
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,330
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.

449
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,130
Transmission commencing.

450
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,260
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,550
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,100
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,060
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,430
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,060
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,780
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,910
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,080
Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?

459
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,120
" Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon. "

460
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,960
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,010
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,090
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,180
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,600
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,480
Come on.
Let's keep a little optimism here.

466
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,110
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,040
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,450
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,580
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,290
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,220
" Shuttle Tydirium... "

472
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,720
" deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately. "

473
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,140
" Follow your present course. "

474
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,770
Okay. I told you it was gonna work.

475
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,100
No problem.

476
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,510
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,410
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,530
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,660
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,460
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,960
Hey...

482
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,380
it's me.

483
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,990
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,620
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,130
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,470
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:40,810
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,610
Quick, jam their comlink.
Center switch.

489
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,790
Move closer.

490
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,750
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,250
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,970
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,440
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,700
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,330
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,500
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,660
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,540
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,170
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,860
Cut it out.

501
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,760
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,480
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,770
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,770
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,740
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,870
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,080
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,290
That's right.

509
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:06,930
Come on.

510
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,530
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,620
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,710
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,470
What is it?

514
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,460
Freeze!

515
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,840
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,020
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,020
What the...

518
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,620
Come on. Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:47,500
I told you to remain on the command ship.

520
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:53,970
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,260
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,020
My son is with them.

523
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,310
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,280
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:18,080
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,950
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,330
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,460
He will come to me?

529
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:33,050
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:37,220
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:41,310
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,640
As you wish.

533
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,620
Master Luke.

534
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,050
There's two more wrecked speeders
back there.

535
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,130
And I found this.

536
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:20,970
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,020
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:35,650
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:52,670
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

540
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,380
Chewie, wait! Don't!

541
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,350
Nice work.

542
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,970
Great, Chewie.

543
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,180
Great.
Always thinking with your stomach.

544
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:10,480
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

545
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,310
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

546
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,900
Yeah. Sure.

547
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:23,490
R2, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

548
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,620
It's a very long drop!

549
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,460
Hey.
Point that thing someplace else.

550
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,130
Hey!

551
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,760
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

552
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,430
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

553
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,140
Oh, my head.

554
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,190
Oh, my goodness.

555
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,930
Do you understand anything they're saying?

556
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,480
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

557
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,400
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...

558
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,190
What are you telling them?

559
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,440
"Hello," I think.

560
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:24,610
I could be mistaken...
they're using a very primitive dialect...

561
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,330
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

562
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:37,080
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

563
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,090
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

564
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:42,460
Proper?

565
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:45,220
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

566
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,590
Why, you...

567
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,350
My mistake.

568
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,980
He's an old friend of mine.

569
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:28,510
Hey.

570
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:48,160
I have a really bad feeling about this.

571
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,760
What did he say?

572
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,220
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo...

573
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:16,850
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honor.

574
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,750
Your Royal Highness.

575
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,660
These are my friends.

576
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:45,960
3PO, tell them they must be set free.

577
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:06,900
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

578
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:10,950
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

579
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,030
you'll become angry and use your magic.

580
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,530
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...

581
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,200
Tell them.

582
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:35,220
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

583
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,930
just as I said they wouldn't.

584
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,350
Wait.

585
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,900
What's happening?

586
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,990
Put me down! Help!

587
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,700
Somebody!

588
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,120
Somebody help!

589
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,960
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

590
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,110
Thank goodness.

591
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,130
Thanks, 3PO.

592
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,300
I never knew I had it in me.

593
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:01,350
...Tatooine...

594
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,190
Princess Leia... R2.

595
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,810
...Darth Vader!

596
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,690
...Death Star.

597
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,950
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

598
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,460
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

599
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,880
Master Luke...

600
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:41,180
...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.

601
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:44,930
...Vader!

602
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:47,230
Han Solo...

603
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:50,860
...carbon.

604
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,690
...Sarlacc.

605
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:18,220
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

606
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,610
Wonderful.
We are now a part of the tribe.

607
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,900
Just what I always wanted.

608
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,040
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

609
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,720
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

610
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,930
Good. How far is it?

611
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,510
Ask him.

612
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,020
We need some fresh supplies too.

613
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,100
Try and get our weapons back.

614
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,770
Hurry up. I haven't got all day.

615
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,150
Luke, what's wrong?

616
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:23,530
Leia, do you remember your mother...

617
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,700
your real mother?

618
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:29,330
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

619
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,370
What do you remember?

620
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,080
Just images really. Feelings.

621
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:35,670
Tell me.

622
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,550
She was... very beautiful.

623
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:43,300
Kind... but sad.

624
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:48,270
Why are you asking me this?

625
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:50,850
I have no memory of my mother.

626
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,940
I never knew her.

627
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:57,860
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

628
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:06,620
Vader is here. Now. On this moon.

629
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,910
How do you know?

630
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,960
I felt his presence.

631
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:16,210
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

632
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,250
That's why I have to go.

633
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:21,840
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

634
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,840
- I have to face him.
- Why?

635
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,730
He's my father.

636
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,230
Your father?

637
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:43,610
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

638
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,570
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

639
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,200
Don't talk that way.

640
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:52,830
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

641
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,960
You're wrong, Leia.

642
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,920
You have that power too.

643
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,380
In time, you'll learn to use it as I have.

644
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:07,260
The Force is strong in my family.

645
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,720
My father has it.

646
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,020
I have it.

647
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,440
And...

648
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:19,150
my sister has it.

649
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,570
Yes. It's you, Leia.

650
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:35,290
I know.

651
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,750
Somehow...

652
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:43,210
I've always known.

653
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,300
Then you know why I have to face him.

654
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,850
Luke, run away. Far away.

655
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:53,310
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

656
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,690
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

657
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:58,770
You've always been strong.

658
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:02,360
But why must you confront him?

659
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,200
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

660
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,320
He won't turn me over to the emperor.

661
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:11,580
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

662
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:14,790
I have to try.

663
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,270
Hey, what's going on?

664
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:40,310
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

665
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:43,150
Nothing?

666
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:47,030
Tell me. What's going on?

667
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:54,370
I can't tell you.

668
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:58,620
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

669
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,930
I'm sorry.

670
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:23,270
Hold me.

671
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,700
This is the rebel that surrendered.

672
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:21,750
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

673
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,580
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

674
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,090
He was armed only with this.

675
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:32,090
Good work, Commander.

676
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:34,130
Leave us.

677
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:37,930
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

678
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:41,020
Yes, my lord.

679
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,100
The emperor has been expecting you.

680
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,940
I know, Father.

681
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,780
So, you have accepted the truth.

682
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:56,410
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

683
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:59,790
That name
no longer has any meaning for me.

684
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:03,290
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

685
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,710
I know there is good in you.

686
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,460
The emperor hasn't driven it
from you fully.

687
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,630
That was why you couldn't destroy me.

688
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,220
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

689
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,520
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.

690
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:35,110
Your skills are complete.

691
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:44,960
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

692
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,670
Come with me.

693
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:56,590
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

694
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,600
You don't know
the power of the dark side.

695
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,520
I must obey my master.

696
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,060
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

697
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:14,030
If that is your destiny.

698
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:17,950
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

699
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,700
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

700
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:25,370
It is too late for me, son.

701
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:32,920
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

702
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,720
He is your master now.

703
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,140
Then my father is truly dead.

704
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:30,230
The main entrance to the control bunker is
on the far side of that landing platform.

705
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:34,690
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

706
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:37,940
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

707
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,910
What's he saying?

708
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,370
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

709
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,980
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

710
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:16,820
Proceed with the countdown.

711
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:20,490
All groups assume attack coordinates.

712
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:25,820
Don't worry. My friend's down there.

713
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,490
He'll have that shield down on time.

714
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:33,960
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

715
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,630
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

716
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:41,720
All right. Stand by.

717
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,450
Back door, huh? Good idea.

718
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,830
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

719
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,800
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

720
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,430
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

721
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:28,050
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

722
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:31,180
I'm afraid our furry companion...

723
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:33,430
has gone and done something rather rash.

724
01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:40,900
There goes our surprise attack.

725
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,450
Look, over there! Stop him!

726
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:05,300
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

727
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,970
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

728
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:12,310
I have decided that we shall stay here.

729
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:43,170
Hey!

730
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,110
Welcome, young Skywalker.

731
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,570
I have been expecting you.

732
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:55,580
You'll no longer need those.

733
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,920
Guards, leave us.

734
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,800
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

735
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:19,020
In time, you will call me master.

736
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:21,690
You're gravely mistaken.

737
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,900
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

738
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:28,480
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

739
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:34,700
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

740
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:40,250
about a great many things.

741
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:43,420
His lightsaber.

742
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,420
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

743
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:50,590
Much like your father's.

744
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:55,510
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

745
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:58,470
So will it be with you.

746
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,520
You're wrong.

747
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,890
Soon I'll be dead... and you with me.

748
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:11,610
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

749
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,860
Yes.

750
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:19,120
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

751
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:23,160
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

752
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:26,420
Your faith in your friends is yours.

753
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,590
It is pointless to resist, my son.

754
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:42,060
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

755
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,390
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

756
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:49,860
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

757
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:54,280
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

758
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,820
to know the location
of the shield generator.

759
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:01,990
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

760
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,370
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

761
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:12,630
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

762
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:17,970
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

763
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:22,850
All right!

764
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,480
Up! Move!

765
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,060
Quickly. Quickly.

766
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,190
Han, hurry.

767
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:34,190
The fleet will be here any moment.

768
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,200
Charges. Come on. Come on!

769
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,160
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

770
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,710
Wait! Come back!

771
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,040
R2, stay with me.

772
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,710
Freeze!

773
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:59,010
You rebel scum.

774
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:22,070
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

775
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:25,410
- Gray Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

776
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,370
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

777
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,170
May the Force be with us.

778
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:40,760
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield... up or down.

779
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:45,100
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...

780
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:47,720
if we're coming.

781
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:51,350
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

782
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,560
I get no reading. You sure?

783
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,900
" Pull up! All craft pull up! "

784
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,320
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

785
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:08,910
Admiral, we have enemy ships in Sector 47.

786
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,580
It's a trap.

787
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,090
Fighters coming in.

788
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:20,920
There's too many.

789
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:27,600
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

790
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,810
Copy, Gold Leader.

791
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,690
Come, boy.

792
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,520
See for yourself.

793
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:44,410
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

794
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:48,370
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

795
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:56,000
You want this...

796
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:58,630
don't you?

797
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:03,300
The hate is swelling in you now.

798
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:06,220
Take your Jedi weapon.

799
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,100
Use it.

800
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,180
I am unarmed.

801
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:12,180
Strike me down with it.

802
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:14,850
Give in to your anger.

803
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:21,030
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

804
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:29,620
It is unavoidable.

805
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:32,870
It is your destiny.

806
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:37,080
You, like your father...

807
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:38,790
are now...

808
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,340
mine.

809
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,860
All right, move it.

810
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:11,450
Hello. I say, over there.

811
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,580
Were you looking for me?

812
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:17,960
Bring those two down here.

813
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:29,890
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

814
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:31,350
Freeze.

815
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:32,600
Don't move.

816
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,640
We surrender.

817
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:42,190
The code's changed.

818
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:44,690
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

819
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,820
R2, where are you?

820
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,900
We need you at the bunker right away.

821
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,530
Going? What do you mean?

822
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,820
Going where, R2?

823
01:39:55,910 --> 01:40:00,160
Wait.
R2, this is no time for heroics.

824
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:01,960
Come back!

825
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:29,980
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

826
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:33,070
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

827
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,030
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

828
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,910
Cut left. I'll take the leader.

829
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:49,960
They're heading for the medical frigate.

830
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,180
Pressure's steady.

831
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:08,650
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Star destroyers waiting for?

832
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,990
We're in attack position, sir.

833
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:18,280
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

834
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:21,700
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

835
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,790
We only need to keep them from escaping.

836
01:41:25,410 --> 01:41:29,540
As you can see, my young apprentice...

837
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:32,880
your friends have failed.

838
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,090
Now witness the firepower...

839
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:41,560
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

840
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,270
Fire at will, Commander.

841
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:54,030
Fire.

842
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:03,200
That blast came from the Death Star.

843
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,460
That thing's operational.

844
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,420
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

845
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,630
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

846
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:12,960
You won't get another chance
at this, Admiral.

847
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:15,840
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

848
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,260
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

849
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:23,060
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

850
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:43,370
We're coming.

851
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,500
Come on.

852
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:55,750
R2, hurry!

853
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,760
My goodness!

854
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:10,730
Why did you have to be so brave?

855
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:16,530
Well, I suppose
I could hot-wire this thing.

856
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:18,110
I'll cover you.

857
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:02,150
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

858
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:04,990
and engage those Star destroyers
at point-blank range.

859
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:08,540
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Star destroyers.

860
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,290
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

861
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,670
and we might take a few of them with us.

862
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:17,960
She's gonna blow!

863
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:23,630
I'm hit!

864
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,930
Your fleet is lost...

865
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:35,100
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

866
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,820
There is no escape...

867
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:42,570
my young apprentice.

868
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:47,240
The Alliance will die...

869
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:52,000
as will your friends.

870
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:56,880
Good.

871
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:01,170
I can feel your anger.

872
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:06,390
I am defenseless. Take your weapon.

873
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:09,640
Strike me down with all of your hatred...

874
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:14,270
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

875
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,600
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

876
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:50,760
I think I got it.

877
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,180
I got it!

878
01:47:59,390 --> 01:48:00,730
Are you all right?

879
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:02,730
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

880
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,150
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

881
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:05,770
Don't move.

882
01:48:10,190 --> 01:48:12,990
- I love you.
- I know.

883
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:14,410
Hands up.

884
01:48:15,530 --> 01:48:16,740
Stand up.

885
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:28,050
Stay back.

886
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:38,680
Get down here. She's wounded.

887
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,640
No, wait.

888
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,350
I got an idea.

889
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:55,160
Good.

890
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:59,080
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

891
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,950
Let the hate flow through you.

892
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:11,170
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

893
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:17,010
I will not fight you, Father.

894
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:33,940
You are unwise to lower your defenses.

895
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,260
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

896
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:04,520
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

897
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,140
There is no conflict.

898
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,440
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

899
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,530
and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

900
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:18,200
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

901
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:19,950
If you will not fight...

902
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:22,870
then you will meet your destiny.

903
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:37,090
Good.

904
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:49,390
- Watch out. Squad at .06.
- I’m on it, Gold Leader.

905
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,730
Good shot, Red Two.

906
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:59,450
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

907
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:01,240
Don't let me down.

908
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:07,250
" It's over, Commander. "

909
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:09,710
" The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing. "

910
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:12,420
" We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit. "

911
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:15,420
Send three squads to help.

912
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:17,510
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

913
01:51:31,650 --> 01:51:33,110
Throw me another charge.

914
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:53,460
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

915
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:56,630
I will not fight you.

916
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:03,180
Give yourself to the dark side.

917
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,810
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

918
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:11,560
Yes.

919
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:13,650
Your thoughts betray you.

920
01:52:13,730 --> 01:52:16,320
Your feelings for them are strong...

921
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,320
especially for...

922
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:21,950
sister.

923
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:27,740
So you have a twin sister.

924
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:31,580
Your feelings have now betrayed her too.

925
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:35,790
Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.

926
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:40,340
Now his failure is complete.

927
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,590
If you will not turn to the dark side...

928
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:48,510
then perhaps she will.

929
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:49,560
Never!

930
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:36,900
Good!

931
01:53:41,190 --> 01:53:43,940
Your hate has made you powerful.

932
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:50,120
Now, fulfill your destiny...

933
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:54,370
and take your father's place at my side.

934
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:10,680
Never.

935
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,930
I'll never turn to the dark side.

936
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:21,730
You've failed, Your Highness.

937
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:23,820
I am a Jedi...

938
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,990
like my father before me.

939
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:37,040
So be it, Jedi.

940
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:39,210
Move! Move!

941
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:55,640
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

942
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:59,520
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

943
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,610
I told you they'd do it.

944
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:11,320
If you will not be turned...

945
01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:14,830
you will be destroyed.

946
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:23,380
Young fool.

947
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:27,380
Only now, at the end...

948
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:29,380
do you understand.

949
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:48,360
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

950
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:56,030
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

951
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:03,290
Father, please!

952
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,890
Now, young Skywalker...

953
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:24,810
you will die.

954
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:52,380
No.

955
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:56,760
Nooo!

956
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:49,110
I'm going in.

957
01:57:52,190 --> 01:57:53,490
Here goes nothing.

958
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:04,460
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

959
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:10,130
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

960
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:27,770
Split up and head back to the surface.

961
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:31,060
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

962
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:32,190
Copy, Gold Leader.

963
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:44,040
That was too close.

964
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,210
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

965
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:53,380
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Star destroyer.

966
01:58:59,470 --> 01:59:01,640
Sir, we've lost
our bridge deflector shields.

967
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:04,770
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

968
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:09,060
Intensify forward firepower!

969
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:12,060
Too late!

970
01:59:57,110 --> 02:00:01,030
Help me take this mask off.

971
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:02,870
But you'll die.

972
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:07,450
Nothing can stop that now.

973
02:00:08,450 --> 02:00:10,120
Just for once...

974
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:12,710
let me...

975
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:16,300
look on you with my own eyes.

976
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:56,960
Now go, my son.

977
02:00:58,590 --> 02:00:59,960
Leave me.

978
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,590
No. You're coming with me.

979
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:06,050
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

980
02:01:06,890 --> 02:01:10,680
You already have, Luke.

981
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:13,690
You were right.

982
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:16,810
You were right about me.

983
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:20,530
Tell your sister...

984
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:23,860
you were right.

985
02:01:30,830 --> 02:01:32,000
Father.

986
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:37,670
I won't leave you.

987
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:04,070
There it is.

988
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:09,410
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

989
02:02:09,490 --> 02:02:12,870
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

990
02:02:32,010 --> 02:02:35,230
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

991
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:24,110
They did it!

992
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:34,990
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

993
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:38,580
He wasn't.

994
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:40,370
I can feel it.

995
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,630
You love him.

996
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:51,430
Don't you?

997
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:53,010
Yes.

998
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,850
All right. I understand.

999
02:03:55,930 --> 02:03:57,350
Fine.

1000
02:03:58,350 --> 02:04:00,190
When he comes back...

1001
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:03,020
I won't get in the way.

1002
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:07,690
It's not like that at all.

1003
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,740
He's my brother.

1004
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:56,760
Wesa free!
