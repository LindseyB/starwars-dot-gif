Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,357
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

4
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,469
I finished my circle.

5
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,079
I don't pick up
any life readings.

6
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,918
<i>There isn't enough life
on this ice cube...</i>

7
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,359
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

8
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,198
<i>Sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

9
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,958
Right.
I'll see you shortly.

10
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,832
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

11
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,076
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

Steady, girl.
What's the matter?

You smell something?

15

All right!
Don't lose your temper.

No sign of life
out there, General.

23

The sensors are in place.

24

You'll know if anything
comes around.

25

Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

26

No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

27
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,236
With all the meteor activity
in this system...

28
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,952
it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

29
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,196
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay any more.

I'm sorry to hear that.

31

Well, there's
a price on my head.

32

If I don't pay off
Jabba the Hutt...

33

I'm a dead man.

34
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,271
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

35

You're a good fighter, Solo.

36

Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

39

That's right.

40
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,676
Well, don't get
all mushy on me.

41
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,313
So long, Princess.

I thought you had
decided to stay.

45
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,917
Well, the bounty hunter
we ran into in Ord Mantell...

46
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,870
changed my mind.

47

You probably don't.

And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

55

Come on!

56
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,990
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

57

Yes! You're
a great help to us.

Am I? Then why are
you following me?

64
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,273
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

65
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,719
I'd just as soon
kiss a Wookiee!

66
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,159
I can arrange that.

67
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,748
You could use
a good kiss!

68
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,395
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

69

I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

82

Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.

I haven't seen him.

He might have
forgotten to check in.

Not likely.
Are the speeders ready?

108
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,631
We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

109

We'll have to go out
on tauntauns.

That's right,

Not much time.

166
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,236
Ben.

167
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,353
Hang on, kid.

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,476
Dagobah system.

169
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,510
Whew!

170
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,393
This may smell bad, kid...

171
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,397
Yoda.

172
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,112
but it'll keep you warm...

173
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,390
till I get the shelter up.

174
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,875
Ben... Dagobah...

175
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,558
Ahhh!

176
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,754
Ah! I thought they
smelled bad on the outside!

177
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,235
Echo Base,
I've got something.

178
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,272
Not much,
but it could be a life form.

179
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,390
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

180
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,317
This is Rogue Two.

181
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,590
This is Rogue Two.

182
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,315
Captain Solo,
do you copy?

183
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,629
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

184
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,069
This is Rogue Two.

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,870
<i>Nice of you guys
to drop by.</i>

187
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,275
Echo Base,
this is Rogue Two.

188
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,719
I've found them.

189
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,512
Repeat, I've found them.

190
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

191
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,109
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

192
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,070
Thanks, 3PO.

R2 expresses
his relief also.

195
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,559
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

196
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,999
You look strong enough...

197
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,917
to pull the ears
off a gundark.

198
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,359
Thanks to you.

199
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,914
That's two
you owe me, junior.

200
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,758
Well, Your Worship...

201
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,348
looks like you managed to
keep me around for a little while longer.

202
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,959
I had nothing
to do with it.

203
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,718
General Rieekan
thinks it's dangerous...

204
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,955
for any ships
to leave the system...

205
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,308
until we've activated
the energy field.

206
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,237
That's a good story.

207
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,634
<i>I think you just can't bear...</i>

208
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,115
to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

209
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,391
I don't know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

210
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,078
Hah hah hah!

211
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,197
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

212
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,551
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

213
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,989
She expressed her
true feelings for me.

214
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,394
My--

215
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,318
Why, you stuck-up,
half-witted...

216
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,874
scruffy-looking
nerf herder!

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,912
Who's scruffy-looking?

218
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,356
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

219
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,391
to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

220
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,070
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

<i>Headquarters personnel,

223
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,950

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,355
Excuse us, please.

225
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,151
Princess, we have a visitor.

226
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,511
Picked up something
outside the base's Zone 12 moving east.

227
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,834
It's metal.

228
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,995
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

229
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,599
Could be a speeder,
one of ours.

230
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,675
No.

231
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,074
Wait.

232
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,714
There's something very weak
coming through.

[Radio Static]

234
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,878
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

235
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,594
This signal is not used
by the Alliance.

236
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,080
It could be
an imperial code.

237
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:00,718
It could be
an imperial code.

238
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,712
It isn't friendly,
whatever it is.

239
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,637
Come on, Chewie,
let's check it out.

240
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,832
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

241
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,589
Grrr!

242
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,592
Gahhh!

243
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,549
<i>I'm afraid
there's not much left.</i>

244
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,510
What was it?

245
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,039
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>

246
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,230
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

247
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,679
An imperial probe droid.

248
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,678
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

249
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,677
We'd better start
the evacuation.

250
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,952
Admiral.

251
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,399
Yes, Captain?

252
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,590
I think we've got
something, sir.

253
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,792
The report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the Hoth system...

254
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,558
but it's the best lead we've had.

255
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,558
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

256
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,715
I want proof,
not leads.

257
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,432
The visuals indicate
life readings.

258
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,595
It could mean anything.

259
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,358
If we followed up
every lead--

260
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,914
But, sir, the Hoth system
is supposed to be devoid of humans.

261
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,149
You've found something?

262
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,315
Yes, my lord.

263
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,875
That's it.
The rebels are there.

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,278
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

265
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,230
It could be smugglers--

266
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,032
That is the system.

267
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,435
And I'm sure Skywalker
is with them.

268
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,438
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

269
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,630
General Veers,
prepare your men.

270
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,079
Admiral.

271
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,751
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

272
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,472
As soon as each transport is loaded...

273
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,477
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

274
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,510
Right, sir.

275
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,511
All right!
That's it.

276
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,595
Try it.

277
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,312
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off!

278
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,510
Turn it off!

279
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,110
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

280
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,070
Forget the heavy equipment.

281
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,474
There's plenty of time...

282
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,953
to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

283
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,910
Take care, sir.

284
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,950
Thanks.

285
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,872
Chewie, take care
of yourself, O.K.?

286
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,117
O.K., O.K.!

287
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,993
Hi, kid.

288
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,109
There's got to be
a reason for it.

289
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,514
Check it
at the other end.

290
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,755
Wait a second.

291
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,154
You all right?

292
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,508
Yeah.

293
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,875
Be careful.

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,638
You, too.

295
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,199
General, there's a fleet
of Stardestroyers...

296
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,073
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

297
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,953
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

298
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,833
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

299
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,359
Prepare for ground assault.

300
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,637
What is it, General?

301
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,239
My lord, the fleet has moved out
of light speed.

302
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,430
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

303
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,835
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

304
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,428
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

305
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,120
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

306
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,993
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

307
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,917
He-- He felt surprise
was wiser.

308
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,395
He is as clumsy
as he is stupid.

309
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,671
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

310
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,199
Yes, my lord.

311
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,632
Lord Vader.

312
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,671
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to--

313
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,313
Aaugh!

314
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,955
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

315
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,195
Captain Piett.

316
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,833
Yes, my lord?

317
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,793
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

318
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,753
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

319
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,952
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

320
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,399
Thank you,
Lord Vader.

321
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,078
[Gagging]

322
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,118
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

323
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,879
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

324
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,036
Only two fighter escorts
per ship.

325
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,754
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

326
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,189
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

327
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,595
Two fighters against
a Stardestroyer?

328
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,995
The ion cannon
will fire several shots...

329
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,998
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

330
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,076
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

331
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,191
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

332
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,639
Understood?

333
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,079
Good luck.

334
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,997
O.K. Everybody
to your stations.

335
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,235
Let's go.

336
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,911
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

337
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,519
Prepare to open shield.

338
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,236
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

339
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,316
Good. Our first catch
of the day.

340
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,831
Stand by, ion control.

341
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,230
Fire.

342
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,793
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

343
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,196
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

344
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,552
Feeling all right, sir?

345
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,318
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

346
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,352
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

347
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,516
I know what you mean.

348
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,189
Echo Station
Three-T-Eight.

349
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,958
We've spotted
imperial walkers.

350
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,230
<i>Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.</i>

351

[Thudding]

352
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,155
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

353
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,271
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

354
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,436
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

355
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,959
Steady, Dak.

356
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,832
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

357
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,038
All right.
I'm coming in.

358
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,436
Hobbie,
you still with me?

359
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,236
That armor's too strong
for blasters.

360
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,670
Rogue Group, use your harpoons
and tow cables.

361
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,395
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

362
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,351
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

363
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,153
Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction
in fire control.

364
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,191
I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

365
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,754
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.

366
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,916
Get ready to fire
that tow cable.

367
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,915
Ah!

368
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,030
Dak?

369
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,115
Dak!

370
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,998
Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached
the main power generators.

371
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,519
The shield will be down
in moments.

372
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,200
You may start your landing.

373
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,998
Rogue Three.

374
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,235
Copy, Rogue Leader.

375
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,112
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.

376
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,434
You'll have to
make this shot.

377
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,198
I'll cover for you.

378
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,630
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

379

Coming around,

Activate harpoon.

382

Good shot, Janson.

383
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,035
- One more pass.
- Coming around, Wedge.

384
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,550
Cable out.
Let her go!

385
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,432
Detach cable.

386
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,629
Cable detached.

387
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,758

Hah! That got him!

389
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,758
I see it, Wedge.
Good work.

390
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,191
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

391
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,470
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

392
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,875
We have no choice.

393

Yeah. I'm with you,

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,956
Don't do that.

654
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,113
Oh!

655
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,753
[Chuckling]

656
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,709
[Groaning]

657
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,400
You're making a mess.

658
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,555
[Chuckling]

659
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,398
Hey, give me that!

660
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,954
Mine, or I will
help you not.

661
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,752
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

662
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,791
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.

663
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,239
Mud-hole? Slimy?

664
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,874
My home this is--

665
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,309
Wha-- Mmm!

666
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,998
R2, let him have it.

667
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,110
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

668
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,275
R2!

669
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,755
Now, will you move along,
little fellow?

670
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,438
We've got a lot
of work to do.

671
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,913
No! No, no!

672
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,316
Stay and help you I will...
find your friend.

673
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,590
I'm not looking
for a friend.

674
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,914
I'm looking
for a Jedi master.

675
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,079
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

676
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,633
You seek Yoda.

677
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,829
You know him?

678
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,157
Mmmm.
Take you to him I will.

679
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,717
Yes, yes, but now
we must eat. Come.

680
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,353
Good food.

681
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,754
Come.

682
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,312
Come, come.

683
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,231
R2... stay and watch
after the camp.

684
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,360
Oh! Where is R2
when I need him?

685
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,392
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

686
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,112
but it has the most
peculiar dialect.

687
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,117
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling...

688
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,593
on the negative axis
has been polarized.

689
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,075
I'm afraid you'll have
to replace it.

690
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,272
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

691
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,799
Here!

692
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,592
And, Chewie...

693
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,749
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

694
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,749
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

695
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,075
Would you please
stop calling me that?

696
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,191
Sure, Leia.

697
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,231
You make it
so difficult sometimes.

698
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,191
I do. I really do.

699
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,073
You could be a little nicer, though.

700
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,953
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

701
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,755
Occasionally... maybe...

702
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,314
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

703
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,112
Scoundrel?

704
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,673
Scoundrel?

705
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,309
I like the sound of that.

706
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,270
Stop that.

707
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,992
Stop what?

708
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,076
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

709
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,509
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

710
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,709
Afraid?

711
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,637
You're trembling.

712
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,318
I'm not trembling.

713
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,433
You like me because
I'm a scoundrel.

714
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,471
There aren't enough scoundrels
in your life.

715
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,955
I happen to like nice men.

716
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,990
I'm a nice man.

717
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,712
No, you're not. You're--

718
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,319
Sir, sir!

719
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,954
I've isolated the reverse power
flux coupling.

720
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,269
Thank you.

721
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,674
Thank you very much.

722
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,472
Oh, you're perfectly
welcome, sir.

723
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,392
And that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

724
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,953
Considering the amount of
damage we've sustained...

725
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,229
they must have been
destroyed.

726
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,874
No, Captain.
They're alive.

727
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,831
I want every ship
available...

728
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,439
to sweep
the asteroid field...

729
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,788
until they are found.

730
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,868
Lord Vader.

731
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,797
Yes, Admiral.
What is it?

732
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,239
The emperor
commands you...

733
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,679
to make contact
with him.

734
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,677
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

735
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,394
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

736
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,919
Yes, my lord.

737
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,114
What is thy bidding,
my master?

738
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,714
There is a great
disturbance...

739
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,990
in the Force.

740
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,350
I have felt it.

741
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,869
We have a new enemy...

742
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,834
the young rebel
who destroyed the Death Star.

743
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,111
I have no doubt this boy...

744
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,279
is the offspring
of Anakin Skywalker.

745
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,516
How is that possible?

746
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,996
Search your feelings, Lord Vader.

747
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,112
You will know it to be true.

748
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,595
He could destroy us.

749
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,756
He's just a boy.

750
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,189
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

751
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,790
The Force is strong with him.

752
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,991
The son of Skywalker...

753
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,793
must not become a Jedi.

754
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,990
If he could be turned...

755
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,839
he would become a powerful ally.

756
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,394
Yes.

757
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,393
He would be a great asset.

758
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,750
Can it be done?

759
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,668
He will join us or die, master.

760
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,879
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.

761
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,673
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

762
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,630
Patience!

763
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,079
For the Jedi...

764
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,918
it is time
to eat as well.

765
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,837
Hmm? Heh heh.

766
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,952
Eat, eat.

767
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,069
Hot!

768
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,391
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

769
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,432
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

770
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,198
Not far.
Yoda not far.

771
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,357
Patience. Soon you
will be with him.

772
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,233
Root leaf.

773
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,634
I cook.

774
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,958
Why wish you
become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

775
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,116
Mostly because of
my father, I guess.

776
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,389
Ah, father.

777
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,795
Powerful Jedi was he.

778
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,717
Hee hee.
Mmm, powerful Jedi.

779
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,432
Oh, come on.

780
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,913
How could you
know my father?

781
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,678
You don't
even know who I am.

782
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,597
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

783
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,392
We're wasting our time!

784
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,192
I cannot teach him.

785
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,595
The boy has no patience.

786
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,188
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

787
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,355
Hmm...

788
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,155
Much anger in him...

789
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,111
like his father.

790
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,789
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

791
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,838
No.

792
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,678
He is not ready.

793
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,028
Yoda.

794
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,434
I am ready.

795
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,710
Ben--
I can be a Jedi.

796
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,717
Ben, tell him I'm--

797
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,159
Ready, are you?

798
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,430
What know you ready?

799
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,757
For 800 years
have I trained Jedi.

800
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,269
My own counsel will I keep...

801
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,119
on who is to be trained.

802
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,631
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

803
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,557
The most serious mind.

804
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,119
This one a long time
have I watched.

805
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,118
All his life
has he looked away...

806
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,152
to the future,
to the horizon.

807
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,670
Never his mind
on where he was...

808
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,789
hmm?

809
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,751
What he was doing.

810
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,359
Hmph!

811
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,515
Adventure.

812
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,595
Ha!

813
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,039
Excitement. Ha!

814
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,674
A Jedi craves
not these things.

815
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,314
You are reckless!

816
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,273
<i>So was I,
if you remember.</i>

817
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,119
He is too old.

818
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,800
Yes, too old to

01:18:00,233 --> 01:18:01,427
Welcome,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

1150
01:18:01,553 --> 01:18:04,192
I'm the administrator
of this facility.

1151
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:06,110
And who might you be?

1152
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:07,268
Leia.

1153
01:18:07,393 --> 01:18:08,872
Welcome, Leia.

1154
01:18:11,913 --> 01:18:15,144
All right, all right,
you old smoothie.

1155
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:18,504
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1156
01:18:18,633 --> 01:18:19,986
My facilities
are at your--

1157
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:21,387
Well, really!

1158
01:18:21,513 --> 01:18:23,231
<i>What's wrong
with the Falcon?</i>

1159
01:18:23,353 --> 01:18:24,502
Hyperdrive.

1160
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,430
I'll get my people
to work on her.

1161
01:18:26,553 --> 01:18:28,145
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1162
01:18:28,273 --> 01:18:31,026
She's the fastest hunk of junk
in the galaxy.

1163
01:18:31,153 --> 01:18:34,145
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1164
01:18:34,273 --> 01:18:35,626
Not as well as I'd like.

1165
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,709
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1166
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,152
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

1167
01:18:39,273 --> 01:18:40,592
I've had labor difficulties.

1168
01:18:40,713 --> 01:18:42,226
Ha ha ha!

1169
01:18:42,353 --> 01:18:43,832
What's so funny?

1170
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:45,386
You. Listen to you.

1171
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,469
You sound like
a businessman...

1172
01:18:47,593 --> 01:18:48,867
a responsible leader.

1173
01:18:48,993 --> 01:18:51,063
Who'd have
thought that, huh?

1174
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,627
Seeing you brings back
a few things.

1175
01:18:53,753 --> 01:18:54,742
Yeah.

1176
01:18:54,873 --> 01:18:56,591
Yeah, I'm responsible
these days.

1177
01:18:56,713 --> 01:18:58,544
It's the price you pay...

1178
01:18:58,673 --> 01:19:00,504
for being successful.

1179
01:19:02,713 --> 01:19:05,068
Ooh. Nice to see
a familiar face.

1180
01:19:05,193 --> 01:19:06,512
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1181
01:19:06,633 --> 01:19:07,952

<i>[Beep Beep]</i>

1183
01:19:09,513 --> 01:19:11,310
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

1184
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:12,832
I wonder if-- Hello?

1185
01:19:14,513 --> 01:19:15,832
How interesting.

1186
01:19:15,953 --> 01:19:17,466
Who are you?

1187
01:19:17,593 --> 01:19:18,912
Oh, my! I--
I'm terribly sorry.

1188
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:20,466
I didn't mean
to intrude.

1189
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:21,628
No, please don't get up.

1190
01:19:27,873 --> 01:19:29,226
Gahhh.

1191
01:19:39,353 --> 01:19:41,821
Luke, you must complete
the training.

1192
01:19:41,953 --> 01:19:43,545
I can't keep the vision
out of my head.

1193
01:19:43,673 --> 01:19:45,550
They're my friends.
I got to help them.

1194
01:19:45,673 --> 01:19:47,709
You must not go.

1195
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,791
But Han and Leia will die
if I don't.

1196
01:19:50,913 --> 01:19:52,392
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1197
01:19:52,513 --> 01:19:55,232
<i>Even Yoda cannot
see their fate.</i>

1198
01:19:55,353 --> 01:19:57,389
But I can help them.

1199
01:19:57,513 --> 01:19:58,912
I feel the Force.

1200
01:19:59,033 --> 01:20:00,386
<i>But you cannot
control it.</i>

1201
01:20:00,513 --> 01:20:02,902
<i>This is a dangerous
time for you...</i>

1202
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:06,628
<i>when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.</i>

1203
01:20:06,753 --> 01:20:09,825
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

1204
01:20:09,953 --> 01:20:12,865
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1205
01:20:12,993 --> 01:20:16,110
But I've learned
so much since then.

1206
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:19,430
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1207
01:20:19,553 --> 01:20:20,781
You have my word.

1208
01:20:20,913 --> 01:20:22,232
<i>It is you
and your abilities...</i>

1209
01:20:22,353 --> 01:20:23,945
<i>the emperor wants.</i>

1210
01:20:24,073 --> 01:20:27,349
<i>That is why your friends
are made to suffer.</i>

1211
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:29,270
That's why
I have to go.

1212
01:20:29,393 --> 01:20:32,544
<i>Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor...</i>

1213
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:34,550
<i>the way I lost Vader.</i>

1214
01:20:34,673 --> 01:20:36,106
You won't.

1215
01:20:36,233 --> 01:20:38,064
Stopped they must be.

1216
01:20:38,193 --> 01:20:40,388
On this all depends.

1217
01:20:40,513 --> 01:20:42,708
Only a fully trained
Jedi knight...

1218
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,551
with the Force
as his ally...

1219
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,141
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

1220
01:20:47,273 --> 01:20:49,264
If you end
your training now...

1221
01:20:49,393 --> 01:20:53,511
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

1222
01:20:53,633 --> 01:20:56,147
you will become
an agent of evil.

1223
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:57,183
<i>Patience.</i>

1224
01:20:57,313 --> 01:20:59,383
And sacrifice
Han and Leia?

1225
01:20:59,513 --> 01:21:03,392
If you honor
what they fight for... yes.

1226
01:21:03,513 --> 01:21:05,071
<i>If you choose to face Vader...</i>

1227

<i>you will do it alone.</i>

01:21:06,593 --> 01:21:08,504
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

1229
01:21:09,753 --> 01:21:11,664
I understand.

1230
01:21:16,113 --> 01:21:17,262
R2.

1238

Told you, I did.

01:21:49,753 --> 01:21:51,391

<i>That boy

No, there is another.

1247
01:22:26,873 --> 01:22:28,272
The ship's almost finished.

1248
01:22:28,393 --> 01:22:30,384
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1249
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:32,026
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1250
01:22:32,153 --> 01:22:34,542
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

1251
01:22:34,673 --> 01:22:36,823
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1252
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:39,228
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando...

1253
01:22:39,353 --> 01:22:41,628
and see what
I can find out.

1254
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:43,550
I don't trust Lando.

1255
01:22:43,673 --> 01:22:45,903
Well, I don't
trust him either.

1256
01:22:46,033 --> 01:22:48,422
But he is my friend.
Besides...

1257
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:50,350
we'll soon be gone.

1258
01:22:50,473 --> 01:22:53,590
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1259

01:23:26,953 --> 01:23:28,022

01:23:31,033 --> 01:23:32,261
Gahhh!

1264
01:23:32,393 --> 01:23:34,145
Found him
in a junk pile?

1265
01:23:34,273 --> 01:23:36,867
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1266
01:23:36,993 --> 01:23:38,824
Gahhh!

1267
01:23:38,953 --> 01:23:40,511
Lando's got people
that can fix him.

1268

No, thanks.

1269
01:23:42,153 --> 01:23:45,589
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

1270
01:23:45,713 --> 01:23:47,590
Not really.

1277
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:06,786
No, no problem.

1278
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:07,868
Why?

1279
01:24:15,753 --> 01:24:17,948
You see, since we're
a small operation...

1280
01:24:18,073 --> 01:24:19,950
we don't fall into...

1281
01:24:20,073 --> 01:24:22,268
the jurisdiction
of the Empire.

1282
01:24:22,393 --> 01:24:24,953
So you're part of
the Mining Guild, then?

1283
01:24:25,073 --> 01:24:27,064
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1284
01:24:27,193 --> 01:24:28,990
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

1285
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,388
since our customers
are anxious to avoid...

1286
01:24:31,513 --> 01:24:33,504
attracting attention
to themselves.

1287
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:35,624
Aren't you afraid
the Empire's going to find out...

1288
01:24:35,753 --> 01:24:37,789
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1289
01:24:37,913 --> 01:24:40,188
It's always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything we've built.

that'll ensure security.

No! Secret.
Stormtroopers?

1309
01:26:41,033 --> 01:26:42,512
Here?
We're in danger!

1310
01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:44,510
I must
tell the others.

1311
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:46,510
Oh, no,
I've been shot!

1312
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,145
Aaah!

1313
01:27:06,273 --> 01:27:07,262
Aaah!

1314
01:27:07,393 --> 01:27:11,181
Aaaaahhh!

1315
01:27:12,673 --> 01:27:13,992
Lord Vader.

1316
01:27:14,113 --> 01:27:17,344
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

1317
01:27:17,473 --> 01:27:19,225
after I have Skywalker.

1318
01:27:19,353 --> 01:27:21,105
He's no good to me dead.

1319
01:27:21,233 --> 01:27:23,827
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1320
01:27:23,953 --> 01:27:26,148
Aaaahhh!

1321
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:29,504
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

1322
01:27:29,633 --> 01:27:31,863
They must never again
leave this city.

1323
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:33,472
That was never a condition
of our agreement...

1324
01:27:33,593 --> 01:27:35,072
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1325
01:27:35,193 --> 01:27:40,142
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

1326
01:27:40,273 --> 01:27:41,228
No.

1327
01:27:41,353 --> 01:27:42,547
Good. It would be
unfortunate...

1328
01:27:42,673 --> 01:27:46,063
if I had to leave
a garrison here.

1329
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:50,345
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1330
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:54,303
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1331
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:55,707
Oh!

1332
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:58,108
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1333
01:27:58,233 --> 01:28:02,146
Oh, oh, oh,
that's much better.

1334
01:28:02,273 --> 01:28:03,592
Wait! Wait!

1335
01:28:03,713 --> 01:28:05,510
Oh, my!
What have you done?

1336
01:28:05,633 --> 01:28:07,430
I'm backwards...

1337
01:28:07,553 --> 01:28:09,350
you flea-bitten
furball!

1338
01:28:09,473 --> 01:28:11,270
Only an overgrown
mophead like you...

1339
01:28:11,393 --> 01:28:12,951
would be
stupid enough--

1340
01:28:25,953 --> 01:28:27,432
I feel terrible.

1341
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:28,906
Gahhh.

1342
01:28:41,993 --> 01:28:44,268
Why are they
doing this?

1343
01:28:47,273 --> 01:28:50,504
They never even asked me
any questions.

1344
01:28:53,793 --> 01:28:55,306
Lando.

1345
01:28:57,953 --> 01:28:58,908
Grrr!

1346
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,102
Han: Get out of here, Lando.

1347
01:29:00,233 --> 01:29:01,985
Shut up and listen!

1348
01:29:02,113 --> 01:29:04,183
Vader's agreed to turn
Leia and Chewie over to me.

1349
01:29:04,313 --> 01:29:05,905
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1350
01:29:06,033 --> 01:29:07,148
Leia:
What about Han?

1351
01:29:07,273 --> 01:29:08,262
Vader's given him
to the bounty hunter.

1352
01:29:08,393 --> 01:29:09,462
Vader wants us all dead.

1353
01:29:09,593 --> 01:29:10,708
He doesn't want you at all.

1354
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:12,710
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

1355
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,630
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1356
01:29:14,753 --> 01:29:16,630
And we're the bait!

1357
01:29:16,753 --> 01:29:18,505
He's on his way.

1358
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:21,545
You fixed us all
real good, didn't you?

1359
01:29:21,673 --> 01:29:22,788
My friend.

1360
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:26,102
Stop!

1361
01:29:28,073 --> 01:29:29,506
I've done all I can.

1362
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:30,952
I'm sorry
I couldn't do better...

1363
01:29:31,073 --> 01:29:32,586
but I've got
my own problems.

1364
01:29:32,713 --> 01:29:33,987
Yeah.

1365
01:29:34,113 --> 01:29:35,831
You're a real hero.

1366
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:48,267
You certainly have
a way with people.

1367
01:29:51,913 --> 01:29:53,426
Ah... Ah...

1368
01:30:02,073 --> 01:30:04,109
This facility is crude...

1369
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:07,031
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

1370
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:09,428
for his journey to the emperor.

1371
01:30:09,553 --> 01:30:12,226
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

1372
01:30:12,353 --> 01:30:14,548
Good.
Monitor Skywalker...

1373
01:30:14,673 --> 01:30:16,550
and allow him to land.

1374
01:30:16,673 --> 01:30:19,870
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

1375
01:30:19,993 --> 01:30:22,223
You put him in there,
it might kill him.

1376
01:30:22,353 --> 01:30:23,672
I do not want...

1377
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,112
the emperor's prize
damaged.

1378
01:30:25,233 --> 01:30:27,588
We will test it
on Captain Solo.

1379
01:30:49,273 --> 01:30:51,912
If only you'd
attached my legs...

1380
01:30:52,033 --> 01:30:53,864
I wouldn't be
in this ridiculous position.

1381
01:30:53,993 --> 01:30:55,312
Now remember,
Chewbacca...

1382
01:30:55,433 --> 01:30:57,230
you have a responsibility for me...

1383
01:30:57,353 --> 01:30:59,071
so don't do anything foolish.

1384
01:31:11,353 --> 01:31:13,025
What's going on...

1385
01:31:13,153 --> 01:31:14,552
buddy?

1386
01:31:14,673 --> 01:31:17,471
You're being put
into carbon freeze.

1387
01:31:17,593 --> 01:31:20,903
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1388
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:22,352
The Empire
will compensate you...

1389
01:31:22,473 --> 01:31:23,462
if he dies.

1390
01:31:23,593 --> 01:31:25,390
Put him in.

1391
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:26,468
Rrrah!

1392
01:31:26,593 --> 01:31:28,902
Rrrah! Rrrah!

1393
01:31:29,033 --> 01:31:30,830
Han: Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!

1394
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:34,263
3PO: Yes, stop, please!
I'm not ready to die!

1395

Hey! Hey!
Listen to me, Chewie.

1396
01:31:36,873 --> 01:31:38,784
This won't help me.

1397

Hey, save your strength.

1398
01:31:40,193 --> 01:31:42,661
There will be another time.

1399

The princess--

1400
01:31:44,873 --> 01:31:46,545
You have to
take care of her.

1401

Do you hear me?
Huh?

1402

Gahhh...

Turn around!

1407
01:32:36,953 --> 01:32:38,227
Chewbacca,
I can't see.

1408
01:32:51,913 --> 01:32:53,983
Gahhh.

1409
01:33:33,673 --> 01:33:36,904
Oh, they've encased him
in carbonite.

1410
01:33:37,033 --> 01:33:38,591
He should be quite
well-protected...

1411
01:33:38,713 --> 01:33:40,544
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

1412
01:33:40,673 --> 01:33:43,392
Well, Calrissian,
did he survive?

1413
01:33:43,513 --> 01:33:45,265
Yes, he's alive.

1414
01:33:45,393 --> 01:33:47,384
And in perfect hibernation.

1415
01:33:47,513 --> 01:33:50,346
He's all yours,

Skywalker has
just landed, lord.

Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

Calrissian, take the princess

alter it any further.

01:39:53,433 --> 01:39:56,869
Your destiny lies
with me, Skywalker.

1469
01:39:56,993 --> 01:39:59,712
Obi-Wan knew this
to be true.

1470
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:00,982
No.

1471
01:40:05,273 --> 01:40:06,069
Aaah!

1472
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:09,107
All too easy.

1473
01:40:14,233 --> 01:40:16,508
Perhaps you're
not as strong...

1474
01:40:16,633 --> 01:40:18,385
as the emperor thought.

1475
01:40:19,553 --> 01:40:21,111
Impressive.

1476
01:40:22,993 --> 01:40:24,346
Most impressive.

1477
01:40:27,153 --> 01:40:28,632
Aaah!

1478
01:40:31,553 --> 01:40:33,544
Obi-Wan has
taught you well.

1479
01:40:33,673 --> 01:40:35,789
You have
controlled your fear.

1480
01:40:37,233 --> 01:40:38,632
Now...

1481
01:40:38,753 --> 01:40:41,187
release your anger.

1482
01:40:41,313 --> 01:40:44,464
Only your hatred
can destroy me.

1483
01:40:54,353 --> 01:40:55,547
Ohh!

1484
01:42:49,113 --> 01:42:51,229
The security code
has been changed.

1485
01:42:51,353 --> 01:42:53,150
R2, you can tell
the computer...

1486
01:42:53,273 --> 01:42:54,501
to override
the security systems.

1487
01:42:54,633 --> 01:42:56,908
R2, hurry!

1488
01:42:59,313 --> 01:43:01,349
Attention. This is
Lando Calrissian.

1489
01:43:01,473 --> 01:43:03,703
Attention. The Empire has taken
control of the city.

1490
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:07,269
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1491
01:43:13,513 --> 01:43:14,707
This way.

1492
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:17,108
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1493
01:43:17,233 --> 01:43:21,146
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1496
01:43:41,793 --> 01:43:43,704
<i>in the Millennium
Falcon's hyperdrive.</i>

1497

1498

Just open the door,

I never doubted you

Wonderful!

1501
01:44:23,713 --> 01:44:25,669
Ouch! Oh! That hurts!

1502

It is useless to resist.

Don't let yourself

Luke, you do not yet realize
your importance.

1517
01:46:11,273 --> 01:46:14,026
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1518
01:46:14,153 --> 01:46:15,632
Join me...

1519

your training.

1520

With our combined strength...

1521

we can end
this destructive conflict...

1522
01:46:23,593 --> 01:46:26,027
and bring order
to the galaxy.

1523
01:46:26,153 --> 01:46:27,552
I'll never join you!

1524

Obi-Wan never told you...

01:46:34,633 --> 01:46:36,430
what happened
to your father.

1528
01:46:36,553 --> 01:46:38,145
He told me enough.

1529
01:46:40,673 --> 01:46:42,425
He told me
you killed him.

1530
01:46:42,553 --> 01:46:43,781
No.

No.

You can destroy
