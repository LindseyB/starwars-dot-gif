R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly go...

518
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,420
I will.

<i>[Han]
Hey, Luke, thanks.</i>

520
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,740
<i>Thanks for coming

That's right, R2.

00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,260
We're going
to the Dagobah system.

You've done well,

531
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,580
And now I sense
you wish to continue...

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,500
your search for
young Skywalker.

533
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,260
Yes, my master.

534
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,180
Patience, my friend.

535

<i>In time,
he will seek you out.</i>

536
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,900
And when he does...

537
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,780
you must bring him
before me.

538
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,060
He has grown strong.

539
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,100
Only together
can we turn him...

540
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,780
to the dark side
of the Force.

541
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,900
As you wish.

542
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:50,180
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

543
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,460

<i>[Beep Whistle]</i>

That face

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,460
Look I so old
to young eyes?

547
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,700
No, of course not.

548
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,620
I do.

Yes, I do.

00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,620
Sick have I become.

Master Yoda,
you can't die.

560
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,940
Strong am I
with the Force...

561
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,420
but not that strong.

562
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,100
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

563
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,700
That is the way of things...

564

the way of the Force.

565
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,460
But I need your help.

566
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,540
I've come back to
complete the training.

567
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,380
No more training
do you require.

568
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,740
Already know you
that which you need.

569
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,060
Then I am a Jedi.

570
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,540
Oh!

571
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,300
[Laughs, Coughs]

572
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,260
Not yet.

573
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,620
One thing remains...

574
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,060
Vader.

575
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,580
You must confront Vader.

576
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,340
Then, only then,
a Jedi will you be.

577
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,940
And confront him
you will.

578
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,580
Master Yoda...

579
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,620
is Darth Vader
my father?

580
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,820
Rest I need.

581
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,300
Yes.

582
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,700
Rest.

583
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,540
Yoda, I must know.

584
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,380
Your father he is.

585
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,460
Told you, did he?

586
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,820
Yes.

587
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,180
Unexpected this is.

588
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,100
And unfortunate.

589
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,540
Unfortunate that
I know the truth?

590
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,100
No.

591
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,540
Unfortunate that you
rushed to face him...

592
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,060
that incomplete
was your training...

593
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,180
that not ready for
the burden were you.

594
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,860
I'm sorry.

595
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,180
Remember...

596
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,940
a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

597
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,940
But beware...

598
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,100
Anger, fear...

599
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,460
aggression...

600
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,540
the dark side are they.

601
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,500
Once you start
down the dark path...

602
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,700
forever will it
dominate your destiny.

603
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,140
Luke...

604
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,380
Luke...

605
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,180
do not...

606
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,980
do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

607
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,860
or suffer your
father's fate you will.

608
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,260
Luke...

609
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,380

Luke...

the Force runs strong
in your family.

613
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,980
Pass on what
you have learned.

614
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,300
Luke...

615
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,740

Why didn't you

You told me Vader...

627
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,260
betrayed and murdered my father.

628
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,540
<i>Your father was seduced by

<i>He ceased to be
Anakin Skywalker...</i>

<i>So what I told you

<i>from a certain
point of view.</i>

<i>that many of the truths

<i>depend greatly

639
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,460
<i>Anakin was
a good friend.</i>

640

<i>When I first knew him...</i>

641
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,900
<i>your father was
already a great pilot...</i>

642
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,940
<i>but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.</i>

00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,260
<i>I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.</i>

<i>I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.</i>

<i>I was wrong.</i>

<i>He's more machine now

<i>You were our only hope.</i>

655
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,300
Yoda spoke of another.

<i>The other he spoke of

<i>The emperor knew,

<i>if Anakin were
to have any offspring...</i>

<i>they would be
a threat to him.</i>

<i>That is the reason...</i>

664
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,180
<i>why your sister remains
safely anonymous.</i>

00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,980
<i>but they could be made
to serve the emperor.</i>

671
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,380
Well, look at you...
a general, huh?

672
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,020
Someone must have told them
about my little maneuver...

673
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,140
at the Battle of Tanaab.

674
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,420
Well, don't look at me, pal.

675
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,860
I just said
you were a fair pilot.

676
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,300
I didn't know they were
looking for somebody...

677
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,980
to lead
this crazy attack.

678
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,180
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

679
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,260
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

680
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,780
You're the respectable
one, remember?

681
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,380
[Chimes]

682
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,660
The emperor's
made a critical error...

683
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,540
and the time for our attack
has come.

684
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,820
The data brought to us
by the Bothan spies...

685
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,740
pinpoint the exact location...

686
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,220
of the emperor's
new battle station.

687
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,540
We also know that the weapon systems
of this Death Star...

688
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,300
are not yet operational.

689
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,700
With the imperial fleet...

690
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,180
spread throughout
the galaxy...

691
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,780
in a vain effort
to engage us...

692
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,780
it is relatively
unprotected.

693
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,300
But most important of all...

694
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,500
we've learned
that the emperor himself...

695
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,900
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

696
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,220
of the construction
of this Death Star.

697
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:42,220
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

698
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,620
Admiral Ackbar, please.

699
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,900
You can see here
the Death Star...

700
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,060
orbiting the forest moon
of Endor.

701
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,580
Although the weapon systems
on this Death Star...

702
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,820
are not yet operational...

703
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,940
the Death Star does have
a strong defense mechanism.

704
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,940
It is protected
by an energy shield...

705
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,460
which is generated...

706
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,980
from the nearby forest moon
of Endor.

707
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,260
The shield
must be deactivated...

708
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,980
if any attack
is to be attempted.

709
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,500
Once the shield is down...

710
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,100
our cruisers
will create a perimeter...

711
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,980
while the fighters fly
into the superstructure...

712
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,940
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

713
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,620
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

714
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,940
Good luck.

715
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,380
You're going
to need it.

716
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,460
General Madine.

717
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,980
We have stolen
a small imperial shuttle.

718
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,940
Disguised as a cargo ship...

719
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,140
and using
a secret imperial code...

720
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,060
a strike team
will land on the moon...

721
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,820
and deactivate
the shield generator.

722
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,140
[C-3PO]
Sounds dangerous.

723
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,500
I wonder who they found
to pull that off.

724
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,500
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

725
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,940
Uh, my team's ready.

726
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,380
I don't have a command crew
for the shuttle.

727
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,660
Arrr!

728
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,460
It's going to be rough, pal.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

729
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,580
Arr!

730
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,660
That's one.

I'm with you, too.

733

What is it?

734
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,980
Ask me again sometime.

1165
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,460
I have to try.

1166
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:15,100
Hey, what's going on?

1167
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,900
Nothing.

1168
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:21,220
I just want to be alone
for a little while.

1169
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,140
Nothing?

1170
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,660
Come on, tell me.

1171
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,380
What's going on?

1172
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,660
I...

1173
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,420
I can't tell you.

1174
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,340
Could you tell Luke?

1175
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,180
Is that
who you could tell?

1176
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,140
I...

1177
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:41,540
Ah.

1178
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,460
I'm sorry.

1179
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:00,740
Hold me.

1180
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,300
This is the rebel
that surrendered to us.

1181
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,580
Although he denies it, I believe
there may be more of them...

1182
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,940
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

1183
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,620
He was armed
only with this.

1184
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,140
Good work, Commander.

1185
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,700
Leave us.

1186
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,620
Conduct your search...

1187
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:14,020
and bring
his companions to me.

1188
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,460
Yes, my lord.

1189
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:19,620
The emperor
has been expecting you.

1190
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,300
I know, Father.

1191
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:25,980
So, you have accepted the truth.

1192
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,620
I've accepted the truth...

1193
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,500
that you were once
Anakin Skywalker, my father.

1194
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,660
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

1195
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:37,060
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

1196
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:39,420
I know there is good
in you.

1197
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,700
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

1198
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:47,260
That was why you
couldn't destroy me.

1199
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,060
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

1200
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:01,260
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.

1201
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,580
Your skills are complete.

1202
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,220
<i>Indeed you are powerful...</i>

1203
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:17,020
as the emperor has foreseen.

1204
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,780
Come with me.

1205
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:28,580
Obi-Wan once thought
as you do.

1206
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:33,660
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

1207
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:35,740
<i>I must obey my master.</i>

1208
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,460
I will not turn...

1209
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:41,100
and you'll be forced to kill me.

1210
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:44,900
If that is your destiny.

1211
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,940
Search your feelings, Father.

1212
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,380
You can't do this.

1213
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:49,940
I feel the conflict within you.

1214
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:51,300
Let go of your hate.

1215
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,660
It is too late for me, son.

1216
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:00,260
The emperor will show you...

1217
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:03,020
the true nature of the Force.

1218
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,940
He is your master now.

1219
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:12,340
Then my father is truly dead.

1220
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:38,020
Urrr.

1221
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,300
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

1222
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,980
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

1223
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,980
This isn't going
to be easy.

1224
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,420
Hey, don't worry.

1225
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,140
Chewie and me got into
a lot of places...

1226
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:05,380
more heavily guarded
than this.

1227
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,140
[Speaking Ewokese]

1228
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,380
[Speaking Ewokese]

1229
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:14,220
[Leia]
What's he saying?

1230
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,140
He says
there's a secret entrance...

1231
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,380
on the other side
of the ridge.

1232
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,300
Admiral, we're in position.

1233
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,940
All fighters accounted for.

1234
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:43,260
Proceed with the countdown.

1235
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:46,180
All groups
assume attack coordinates.

1236
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,060
[Speaking Alien Language]

1237
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:51,300
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

1238
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:54,180
He'll have that shield down on time.

1239
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:55,620
[Speaking Alien Language]

1240
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:59,980
Or this will be
the shortest offensive of all time.

1241
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:04,540
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

1242
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,460
All right. Stand by.

1243
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,980
[Whistle]

1244
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:25,380
[Speaking Ewokese]

1245
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,780
Back door, huh?
Good idea.

1246
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,980
[Speaking Ewokese]

1247
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:33,500
[Speaking Ewokese]

1248
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,380
It's only
a few guards.

1249
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:38,300
This shouldn't be
too much trouble.

1250
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:41,100
[Speaking Ewokese]

1251
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,100
[Speaking Ewokese]

1252
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,460
It only takes one
to sound the alarm.

1253
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,460
Then we'll do it
real quiet like.

1254
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,940
Oh, my!
Princess Leia!

1255
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,820
I'm afraid
our furry companion...

1256
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,140
has gone and done
something rather rash.

1257
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,020
Rrrrooohh.

1258
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,900
Oh, no.

1259
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:02,900
[Han] There goes our
surprise attack.

1260
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,180
[Starts Engine]

1261
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,460
Look, over there!
Stop him!

1262
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:24,660
Not bad for
a little furball.

1263
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,180
There's only one left.

1264
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,620
You stay here.

1265
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,260
We'll take care of this.

1266
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:30,780
I have decided...

1267
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,420
that we shall
stay here.

1268
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,260
Whoo-whoo!

1269
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,140
Yahoo!

1270
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,820
Whoo whoo!

1271
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:46,780
Wa ha ha ha!

1272
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,540
Wa ha ha ha!

1273
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:03,020
Hey!

1274
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,980
Yoooaww!

1275
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,460
Ooohm.

1276
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,980
Welcome, young Skywalker.

1277
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:10,100
I have been expecting you.

1278
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:12,460
You'll no longer need those.

1279
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:19,820
Guards, leave us.

1280
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:30,380
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

1281
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,940
In time,
you will call me master.

1282
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,420
You're gravely mistaken.

1283
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:39,580
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

1284
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:43,820
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

1285
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:50,220
<i>You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...</i>

1286
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:55,300
about a great many things.

1287
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:57,660
[Vader]
His lightsaber.

1288
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:02,140
Ah, yes. A Jedis weapon.

1289
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:04,700
Much like your father's.

1290
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,300
By now you must know...

1291
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,060
your father
can never be turned...

1292
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:10,100
from the dark side.

1293
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:12,980
So will it be with you.

1294
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,380
You're wrong.

1295
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:17,980
Soon I'll be dead,
and you with me.

1296
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,940
Ha ha ha ha!

1297
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:23,300
Perhaps you refer
to the imminent attack...

1298
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,380
of your rebel fleet.

1299
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,580
Yes.

1300
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:29,540
I assure you...

1301
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:33,580
we are quite safe
from your friends here.

1302
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,460
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

1303
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:40,700
Your faith
in your friends is yours.

1304
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:45,500
[Vader]
It is pointless to resist, my son.

1305
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,980
Everything that has transpired...

1306
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:54,340
has done so
according to my design.

1307
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:58,100
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

1308
01:28:58,180 --> 01:29:03,020
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

1309
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:06,220
It was I
who allowed the Alliance...

1310
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:10,100
to know the location
of the shield generator.

1311
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:13,700
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

1312
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:17,900
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

1313
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,660
Oh...

1314
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:23,500
I'm afraid
the deflector shield...

1315
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:29,060
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

1316
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,900
All right, up!
Move! Come on.

1317
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,420
Quickly. Quickly.

1318
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,660
Chewie.

1319
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:40,100
Grr!

1320
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:41,660
Han, hurry!

1321
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:45,500
The fleet will
be here any moment.

1322
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:48,420
Charges!
Come on, come on!

1323
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:52,220
Oh, my!
They'll be captured!
