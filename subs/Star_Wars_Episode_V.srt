1
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,500
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,630
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

3
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,800
" Loud and clear, kid. What's up? "

4
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,590
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,640
" There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser. "

6
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,560
" The sensors are placed.
I'm going back. "

7
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,560
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,770
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,100
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

10
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,310
Steady.

11
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,990
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,950
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,160
All right. Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,710
I'll come right back and give you a hand.

15
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
" FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun! "

16
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,350
Solo.

17
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,230
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

18
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,350
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

19
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,100
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

20
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,700
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

21
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,740
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay anymore.

22
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,620
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

23
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,160
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

24
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,120
A death mark's not an easy thing
to live with.

25
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,210
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

26
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,750
Thank you, General.

27
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,890
Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.

28
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,890
That's right.

29
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,110
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

30
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,320
Han.

31
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,200
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

32
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,160
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

33
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,540
Han, we need you.

34
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,750
- We need?
- Yes.

35
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,330
- What about you need?
- I need?

36
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

37
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,550
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

38
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,130
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

39
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,850
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

40
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,520
No. That's not it.

41
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,270
Come on.

42
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,560
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

43
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,610
Am I? Then why are you following me?

44
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,940
Afraid I'd leave without
giving you a good-bye kiss?

45
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,650
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

46
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,900
You could use a good kiss!

47
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,660
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

48
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,200
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

49
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,160
It's supposed to be freezing.

50
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,710
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

51
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,040
Oh, switch off!

52
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,250
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

53
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,510
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

54
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,680
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

55
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,300
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

56
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,600
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

57
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,600
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

58
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,980
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

59
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,900
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

60
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,310
Deck Officer.

61
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,940
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might I...

62
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,820
Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?

63
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,610
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

64
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,950
It's possible? Why don't you go find out?

65
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,620
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,120
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

67
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,540
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

68
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,670
Come along, R2. Let's find Princess Leia.

69
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,880
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

70
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,640
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

71
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,260
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

72
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,440
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

73
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,520
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

74
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,690
That's right, and my friend's out in it.

75
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,950
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

76
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,120
Then I'll see you in hell.

77
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,840
You must come along now, R2.

78
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,010
There's really nothing more we can do.

79
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,220
And my joints are freezing up.

80
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,230
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

81
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,100
And he'll be quite all right. You'll see.

82
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,900
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

83
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,290
Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no...

84
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,380
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

85
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,590
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

86
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,100
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

87
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,350
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

88
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,810
The shield doors must be closed.

89
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,560
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,820
R2 says the chances of survival
are 725-to-1.

91
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,130
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

92
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,840
from time to time.

93
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,800
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

94
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,390
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

95
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,350
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

96
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,330
" Luke. "

97
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,340
Ben?

98
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,090
You will go to the Dagobah system.

99
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,970
Dagobah system?

100
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,560
There you will learn from Yoda...

101
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,430
the Jedi master who instructed me.

102
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,290
Don't do this, Luke. Give me a sign here.

103
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,320
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,990
Hang on, kid.

105
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,330
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,120
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,420
Yoda.

108
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,000
but it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,170
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,090
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,100
on the outside.

112
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,810
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,850
Not much, but it could be a life-form.

114
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,730
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

115
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,530
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,530
Captain Solo, do you copy?

117
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,670
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

118
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,630
This is Rogue Two.

119
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,880
" Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by. "

120
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,840
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

121
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,560
I've found them. Repeat. I've found them.

122
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,010
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

123
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,340
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

124
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,970
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

125
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,970
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

126
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,890
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

127
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,350
Well, Your Worship...

128
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,570
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

129
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,570
I had nothing to do with it.

130
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,320
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

131
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,360
until we've activated the energy field.

132
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,740
That's a good story.

133
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,790
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

134
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,250
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

135
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,880
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

136
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,090
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

137
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,470
She expressed her true feelings for me.

138
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,720
My...

139
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,260
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

140
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,470
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

141
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,640
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

142
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,360
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

143
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,950
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

144
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:13,760
" Headquarters personnel,
report to command center. "

145
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Take it easy.

146
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,010
Excuse us, please.

147
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,350
Princess, we have a visitor.

148
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,390
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

149
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,770
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

150
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,690
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

151
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,490
There's something very weak
coming through.

152
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,830
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

153
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,080
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

154
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,130
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.

155
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,260
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

156
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,500
" - I'm afraid there's not much left. "
- What was it?

157
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,670
" Droid of some kind.
I didn't hit it that hard. "

158
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,260
- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.

159
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,260
" It's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here. "

160
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,260
We'd better start the evacuation.

161
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,100
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

162
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,400
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

163
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,400
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

164
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,610
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

165
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,700
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

166
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,080
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

167
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,250
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of human forms.

168
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,790
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

169
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,510
That's it. The rebels are there.

170
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,090
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

171
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,970
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

172
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,470
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

173
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,600
Set your course for the Hoth system.

174
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,150
General Veers, prepare your men.

175
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,610
Admiral.

176
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,490
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

177
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,450
As soon as each transport is loaded...

178
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,620
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

179
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,410
Right, sir.

180
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,620
All right. That's it.

181
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,210
Try it.

182
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,710
Turn it off! Turn it off!

183
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,470
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

184
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,220
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

185
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,390
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

186
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,940
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

187
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,320
Okay, okay.

188
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,240
Hi, kid.

189
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,450
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

190
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,000
Wait a second.

191
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,500
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

192
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,880
Be careful.

193
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,880
You too.

194
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,850
General, there's a fleet
of Stardestroyers...

195
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,230
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

196
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,310
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

197
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,530
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

198
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,690
Prepare for ground assault.

199
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,920
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

200
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,130
ComScan has detected an energy field...

201
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,840
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

202
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,430
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

203
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,010
The rebels are alerted to our presence.

204
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,230
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

205
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,600
He felt surprise was wiser.

206
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,810
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

207
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,530
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

208
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,280
Yes, my lord.

209
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,370
" Lord Vader. "

210
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,500
" The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to... "

211
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,710
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

212
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,210
- Captain Piett.
" - Yes, my lord? "

213
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,340
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

214
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,430
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

215
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,720
You are in command now, Admiral Piett.

216
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,680
" Thank you, Lord Vader. "

217
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,350
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

218
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,150
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

219
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,320
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

220
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,530
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

221
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,160
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

222
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,370
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

223
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,540
The ion cannon will fire several shots...

224
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,790
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

225
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,000
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

226
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,170
proceed directly to the rendez-vous point.

227
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,210
Understood?

228
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,920
Good luck.

229
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,550
Everybody to your stations. Let's go.

230
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,740
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

231
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,740
Prepare to open shield.

232
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,700
Sir, rebel ships are coming
into our sector.

233
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,920
Good. Our first catch of the day.

234
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,000
Stand by, ion control.

235
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,090
Fire.

236
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:30,280
" The first transport is away. "

237
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,660
Feeling all right, sir?

238
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,660
Just like new, Dak. How about you?

239
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,710
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

240
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,920
I know what you mean.

241
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,520
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

242
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,110
" Imperial walkers on the north ridge. "

243
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,510
Echo Station 57, we're on our way.

244
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,930
All right, boys, keep tight now.

245
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,180
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

246
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,770
Steady, Dak.

247
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,730
Attack pattern Delta. Go now.

248
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,190
I'm coming in.

249
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,740
Hobbie, you still with me?

250
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,600
That armor's too strong for blasters.

251
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,230
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

252
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,660
Go for the legs. It might be our
only chance of stopping them.

253
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,150
Stand by, Dak.

254
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,070
Luke, we've got a malfunction
in fire control.

255
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,200
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

256
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,200
Just hang on.

257
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,120
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

258
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,540
Dak?

259
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,570
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

260
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,780
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

261
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,950
Rogue Three.

262
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,500
Copy, Rogue Leader.

263
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,580
" Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot. "

264
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,420
" I'll cover for you. "

265
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,920
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

266
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,090
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

267
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,430
Steady, Rogue Two.

268
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,470
Activate harpoon.

269
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,980
Good shot, Janson.

270
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,320
One more pass.

271
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,120
Cable out. Let her go!

272
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,490
Detach cable.

273
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,330
Cable detached.

274
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,840
Come on!

275
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,260
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

276
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,850
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

277
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,270
It's risky,
but we can't hold out much longer.

278
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,020
We have no choice.

279
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,690
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

280
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,080
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

281
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,660
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

282
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,670
And do take good care of yourself.

283
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,880
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

284
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,990
All troops will debark for ground assault.

285
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,580
Prepare to target the main generator.

286
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,710
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

287
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,710
Set harpoon. I'll cover for you.

288
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,210
- Coming around.
- Watch that cross fire, boys.

289
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,430
Set for position three.

290
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,840
Steady.

291
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,470
Stay tight and low. This is it!

292
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,600
Hobbie!

293
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,230
I've been hit!

294
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,610
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

295
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,740
- Heard the command center had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

296
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,280
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

297
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,490
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

298
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,700
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

299
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,420
" Imperial troops have entered the base. "

300
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,170
" Imperial troops have entered... "

301
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,170
Come on. That's it.

302
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,670
Give the evacuation code signal.

303
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,590
And get to your transports.

304
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,850
Wait for me.

305
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,430
Begin retreat!

306
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,350
Fall back!

307
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,410
- Distance to power generators?
" - 1.7. 2.8. "

308
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,420
Target. Maximum firepower.

309
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,370
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

310
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,450
I'll get her out on the Falcon. Come on.

311
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,120
Where are you going? Come back!

312
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,980
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

313
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,980
- How typical.
- Come on.

314
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,700
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

315
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,660
Wait! Wait!

316
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,760
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

317
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,100
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

318
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,060
Sir, might I suggest that you...

319
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,850
It can wait.

320
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,610
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

321
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,820
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.

322
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,750
Come on! Come on!

323
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,880
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

324
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,640
See?

325
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,110
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

326
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,010
Punch it!

327
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,070
R2.

328
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,780
Get her ready for takeoff.

329
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,250
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendez-vous.

330
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,170
Don't worry, R2. We're going. We're going.

331
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,930
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

332
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:35,570
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

333
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,400
Yes, R2.

334
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,280
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

335
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,340
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

336
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,640
Stardestroyers,
two of 'em coming right at us.

337
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,600
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

338
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,400
Check the deflector shield.

339
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,480
Great.
Well, we can still outmaneuver them.

340
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Take evasive action!

341
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,170
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

342
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,840
They're getting closer.

343
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,130
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

344
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,800
Watch what?

345
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,890
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

346
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,480
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

347
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,690
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

348
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,240
Horizontal boosters!

349
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,490
Alluvial dampers.

350
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,960
That's not it. Bring me the hydrospanner.

351
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,130
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

352
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,050
Chewie!

353
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,760
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

354
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,350
Han, get up here.

355
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,480
Come on, Chewie!

356
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,350
Asteroids.

357
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,900
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

358
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,570
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

359
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,450
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

360
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,580
You don't have to do this to impress me.

361
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,870
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

362
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,250
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

363
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,370
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

364
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,120
I take it back.

365
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,330
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

366
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,250
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

367
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,210
I'm going closer to one of the big ones.

368
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,170
- Closer?
- Closer?

369
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,160
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

370
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
There. That looks pretty good.

371
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,240
What looks pretty good?

372
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,750
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

373
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,710
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?

374
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,890
I hope you know what you're doing.

375
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,470
Yeah. Me too.

376
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,520
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

377
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,190
No, I'm not gonna change my mind
about this.

378
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,570
I'm not picking up any cities
or technology.

379
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,740
Massive life-form readings though.

380
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,870
There's something alive down there.

381
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,420
Yes.
I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

382
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,840
I know! I know!

383
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,640
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

384
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,850
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

385
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,610
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

386
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,290
R2?

387
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,420
Where are you?

388
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,340
R2!

389
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,800
You be more careful.

390
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,640
R2, that way.

391
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,010
R2!

392
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,160
Oh, no.

393
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,460
Are you all right? Come on.

394
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,040
You were lucky to get out of there.

395
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,090
Anything broken?

396
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,930
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

397
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,220
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

398
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,020
R2, what are we doing here?

399
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,560
It's like...

400
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,690
something out of a dream or...

401
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,690
I don't know.

402
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,860
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

403
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,600
Yes, Admiral?

404
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,810
Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...

405
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,020
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

406
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,940
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.

407
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:01,610
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

408
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,830
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

409
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,920
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

410
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,090
No. I need you to talk to the Falcon...

411
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,460
find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.

412
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,810
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

413
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,810
Not entirely stable?

414
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,980
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

415
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,690
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

416
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,320
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.

417
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,780
After all, I'm only trying to do my job.

418
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,290
Let go.

419
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,420
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

420
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,250
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

421
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,210
Sorry, sweetheart.

422
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,010
I haven't got time for anything else.

423
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,880
Ready for some power? Okay.

424
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,300
Let's see now.

425
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,720
Put that in there. There you go.

426
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,600
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...

427
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,060
if he even exists.

428
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,450
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

429
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,740
This place gives me the creeps.

430
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,080
Still...

431
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,420
there's something familiar
about this place.

432
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,420
I don't know.

433
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,590
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

434
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,300
Like we're being watched.

435
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,430
Away put your weapon.

436
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,390
I am wondering, why are you here?

437
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,060
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

438
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,810
Found someone you have, I would say.

439
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,610
Right.

440
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,950
Help you I can. Yes.

441
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,990
I don't think so.

442
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,330
I'm looking for a great warrior.

443
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,080
Great warrior.

444
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,420
Wars not make one great.

445
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,510
Put that down.

446
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,600
Hey! That's my dinner.

447
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,600
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

448
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,940
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

449
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,610
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

450
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,820
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

451
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,610
Get out of there.

452
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,160
Hey, you could have broken this.

453
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,830
Don't do that.

454
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,970
You're making a mess.

455
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,510
Hey, give me that.

456
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:54,180
Mine, or I will help you not.

457
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,310
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

458
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,640
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mudhole.

459
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,480
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.

460
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,730
R2, let him have it.

461
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,160
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

462
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,450
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

463
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,750
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.

464
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,550
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

465
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:32,010
Jedi master. Yoda.

466
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,720
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

467
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,560
Take you to him I will.

468
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,940
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

469
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,730
Come. Good food. Come.

470
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,160
Come, come.

471
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,450
R2...

472
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,580
stay and watch after the camp.

473
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,180
Where is R2 when I need him?

474
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,980
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

475
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,020
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

476
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,650
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

477
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,230
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

478
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,610
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

479
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,070
Here. And, Chewie...

480
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,410
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

481
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,440
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

482
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,020
Would you please stop calling me that?

483
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,110
Sure, Leia.

484
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,650
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

485
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,990
You could be a little nicer though.

486
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,780
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

487
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,410
Occasionally, maybe...

488
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,000
when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

489
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,540
Scoundrel?

490
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,220
I like the sound of that.

491
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,090
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

492
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,390
Stop that. My hands are dirty.

493
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,680
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

494
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,980
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

495
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,980
I'm not trembling.

496
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,900
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

497
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,440
There aren't enough scoundrels
in your life.

498
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,610
I happen to like nice men.

499
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,410
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

500
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,330
Sir, sir!

501
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,330
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

502
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,790
Thank you.

503
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,880
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

504
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,100
" That, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes. "

505
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:26,140
" Considering the damage we've sustained,
they must have been destroyed. "

506
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:29,560
No, Captain, they're alive.

507
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:34,070
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

508
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,870
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

509
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,240
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

510
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,540
Move the ship out of the asteroid field...

511
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,910
so that we can send a clear transmission.

512
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,670
Yes, my lord.

513
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,810
What is thy bidding, my master?

514
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:15,150
" There is a great disturbance
in the Force. "

515
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,360
I have felt it.

516
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,030
" We have a new enemy... "

517
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:25,160
" the young rebel
who destroyed the Death Star. "

518
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,410
" I have no doubt this boy... "

519
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,920
" is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker. "

520
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,290
How is that possible?

521
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,800
" Search your feelings, Lord Vader. "

522
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,130
" You will know it to be true. "

523
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,720
" He could destroy us. "

524
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,930
He's just a boy.

525
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,520
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

526
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,230
" The Force is strong with him. "

527
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,530
" The son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi. "

528
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,820
If he could be turned...

529
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,820
he would become a powerful ally.

530
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,530
" Yes. "

531
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:12,660
" He would be a great asset. "

532
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,040
" Can it be done? "

533
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:19,130
He will join us or die, master.

534
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:39,690
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

535
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,610
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

536
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,990
Eat. Eat.

537
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,200
Hot.

538
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Good food. Good.

539
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,970
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

540
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,340
Not far. Yoda not far.

541
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:09,220
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

542
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,310
Root leaf. I cook.

543
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,610
Why wish you become Jedi?

544
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,360
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

545
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,570
Father. Powerful Jedi was he.

546
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,870
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

547
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,450
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

548
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,080
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

549
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,790
I cannot teach him.

550
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,960
The boy has no patience.

551
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,340
" He will learn patience. "

552
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,560
Much anger in him...

553
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,520
like his father.

554
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,390
" Was I any different
when you taught me? "

555
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:59,690
No.

556
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:03,900
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

557
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,820
I am ready.

558
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,870
I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm...

559
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:15,830
Ready, are you? What know you ready?

560
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:19,920
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

561
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,800
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

562
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:29,550
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment...

563
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,510
the most serious mind.

564
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,600
This one a long time have I watched.

565
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,440
All his life has he looked away...

566
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,610
to the future, to the horizon.

567
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:47,320
Never his mind on where he was...

568
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,660
what he was doing.

569
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,370
Adventure.

570
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,370
Excitement.

571
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,790
A Jedi craves not these things.

572
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,500
You are reckless.

573
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,590
" So was I, if you remember. "

574
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:06,760
He is too old.

575
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,930
Yes, too old to begin the training.

576
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,010
But I've learned so much.

577
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,060
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

578
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,280
I'm not afraid.

579
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:37,040
You will be.

580
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,620
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

581
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,750
There's something out there.

582
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,880
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

583
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,050
There it is. Listen!

584
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,050
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

585
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,720
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

586
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,970
Then I'm going with you.

587
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,310
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

588
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,430
Oh, no.

589
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,580
This ground sure feels strange.

590
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,250
It doesn't feel like rock.

591
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,340
There's an awful lot of moisture in here.

592
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,170
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

593
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,510
Yeah.

594
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,510
Watch out!

595
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,100
It's all right. It's all right.

596
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,690
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

597
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,940
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

598
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,940
chewing on the power cables.

599
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,650
Mynocks?

600
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,990
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

601
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,660
Go away! Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

602
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,760
Wait a minute.

603
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,910
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

604
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,080
No time to discuss this in committee!

605
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,000
I am not a committee!

606
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,300
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

607
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,880
Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off.

608
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,010
- Look!
- I see it.

609
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,520
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

610
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,560
- This is no cave.
- What?

611
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,380
Yes, run.

612
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,050
Yes.

613
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:25,510
A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.

614
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,060
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

615
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,350
The dark side of the Force are they.

616
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,070
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

617
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,400
If once you start down the dark path...

618
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,820
forever will it dominate your destiny.

619
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,910
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

620
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,870
Vader.

621
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,080
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

622
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,790
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

623
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,750
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

624
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,130
You will know...

625
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,510
when you are calm, at peace...

626
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,010
passive.

627
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,270
A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defense...

628
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,230
never for attack.

629
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,980
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

630
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,860
Nothing more will I teach you today.

631
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,980
Clear your mind of questions.

632
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,010
There's something not right here.

633
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,350
I feel cold.

634
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,730
- Death.
- That place...

635
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:56,360
is strong with the dark side of the Force.

636
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,400
A domain of evil it is.

637
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,820
In you must go.

638
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,200
What's in there?

639
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,240
Only what you take with you.

640
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,250
Your weapons...

641
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,580
you will not need them.

642
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,120
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

643
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,210
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

644
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,180
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer Avenger.

645
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,840
Right.

646
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:18,770
There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.

647
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,940
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

648
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,190
but I want them alive.

649
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:26,730
No disintegrations.

650
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,730
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

651
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,910
My lord, we have them.

652
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:40,450
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

653
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,170
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

654
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,630
One, two...

655
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,880
three!

656
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:00,770
It's not fair.

657
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,150
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

658
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,230
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

659
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,990
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

660
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,370
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

661
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,200
Turn her around.

662
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,950
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

663
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,080
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

664
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,120
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

665
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,170
Shut up!

666
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,640
They're moving to attack position.

667
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,970
Shields up.

668
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,400
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

669
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,440
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

670
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:55,360
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

671
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:59,320
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

672
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,370
Get a shuttle ready.

673
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:08,420
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

674
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,630
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

675
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,590
Use the Force.

676
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,720
Yes.

677
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:27,100
Now, the stone.

678
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,900
Feel it.

679
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,410
Concentrate!

680
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:04,140
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

681
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,020
So certain are you.

682
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,270
Always with you it cannot be done.

683
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,490
Hear you nothing that I say?

684
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,700
Master, moving stones around is one thing.

685
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,660
This is totally different.

686
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,030
No. No different.

687
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,240
Only different in your mind.

688
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:28,580
You must unlearn what you have learned.

689
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,090
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

690
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,340
Do...

691
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,050
or do not.

692
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,880
There is no try.

693
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:30,390
I can't. It's too big.

694
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,560
Size matters not.

695
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,690
Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?

696
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,320
And well you should not...

697
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,070
for my ally is the Force.

698
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,580
And a powerful ally it is.

699
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,040
Life creates it...

700
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,210
makes it grow.

701
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,880
Its energy surrounds us...

702
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,710
and binds us.

703
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,050
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

704
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:06,390
You must feel the Force around you.

705
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:09,850
Here, between you, me...

706
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,520
the tree, the rock... everywhere.

707
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,610
Yes...

708
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,690
even between the land and the ship.

709
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,830
You want the impossible.

710
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,430
I don't believe it.

711
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,060
That is why you fail.

712
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:44,590
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

713
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:56,140
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

714
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:58,230
If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...

715
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,270
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.

716
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,100
Alert all commands.

717
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:06,610
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

718
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:10,150
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

719
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,070
Admiral.

720
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,540
Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.

721
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:36,720
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.

722
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,930
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

723
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,100
The fleet's beginning to break up.

724
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:45,110
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

725
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,440
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

726
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:53,030
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

727
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:55,240
The Empire may be gracious enough...

728
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,780
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

729
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,830
If they follow
standard imperial procedure...

730
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,120
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

731
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:05,330
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

732
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,880
Then what?

733
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,260
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

734
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,760
Any ideas?

735
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,260
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

736
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,970
The Anoat system. There's not much there.

737
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,930
Oh, wait. This is interesting.

738
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,940
- Lando.
- Lando system?

739
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,650
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

740
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,020
Cardplayer, gambler.

741
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:31,740
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

742
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,530
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

743
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,080
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

744
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,080
Lando conned somebody out of it.

745
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,920
We go back a long way, Lando and me.

746
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,000
- Can you trust him?
- No.

747
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:52,010
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

748
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,760
Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach.

749
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,480
You do have your moments.

750
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,110
Not many of them, but you do have them.

751
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,890
Concentrate.

752
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,230
Feel the Force flow.

753
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,020
Yes.

754
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,320
Good.

755
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:00,820
Calm.

756
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:02,330
Yes.

757
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:05,790
Through the Force, things you will see.

758
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:09,370
Other places. The future. The past.

759
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,920
Old friends long gone.

760
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:23,890
Control, control.

761
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:26,230
You must learn control.

762
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,230
I saw a city in the clouds.

763
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:36,440
Friends you have there.

764
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:41,200
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

765
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,410
Future?

766
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:53,790
Will they die?

767
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,130
Difficult to see.

768
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,760
Always in motion is the future.

769
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,640
I've gotta go to them.

770
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:10,690
Decide you must how to serve them best.

771
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,690
If you leave now, help them you could...

772
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:18,320
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

773
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,170
No, I don't have a landing permit.

774
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:38,920
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

775
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:41,180
Wait a minute! Let me explain!

776
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,260
" You will not deviate
from your present course. "

777
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:46,140
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

778
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:51,810
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

779
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,030
" Permission granted
to land on Platform 327. "

780
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:05,530
Thank you.

781
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:09,330
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

782
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,160
Who's worried?

783
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,380
No one to meet us.

784
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,130
I don't like this.

785
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:08,100
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

786
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,930
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

787
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,720
Trust me.

788
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,480
See? My friend.

789
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,950
Keep your eyes open.

790
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,280
Hey.

791
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:34,500
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

792
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,880
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

793
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,810
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

794
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,980
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

795
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,190
Yes. Very friendly.

796
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,940
What are you doing here?

797
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,070
Repairs. I thought you could help me out.

798
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:05,820
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

799
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,490
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

800
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,780
How you doin', Chewbacca?

801
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,410
Still hanging around with this loser?

802
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,750
Hello. What have we here?

803
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:24,590
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

804
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:27,800
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

805
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,550
Welcome, Leia.

806
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:35,220
All right, all right. You old smoothie.

807
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:38,690
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

808
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,900
My facilities are at your... Well, really!

809
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:44,400
- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.

810
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,570
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

811
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,740
That ship saved my life quite a few times.

812
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,410
She's the fastest hunk of junk
in the galaxy.

813
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,200
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

814
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:59,160
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

815
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:02,380
I've had supply problems of every kind.

816
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,670
I've had labor difficulties.

817
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:08,050
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

818
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:10,970
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

819
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:12,970
Who'd have thought that, huh?

820
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:16,010
Seeing you sure brings back a few things.

821
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,350
Yeah.

822
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,600
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

823
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,150
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

824
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,440
Nice to see a familiar face.

825
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:30,200
How rude!

826
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,820
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

827
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:35,530
I wonder if... Hello?

828
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,330
How interesting.

829
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:42,540
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

830
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,710
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.

831
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,770
Luke, you must complete the training.

832
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,650
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

833
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:11,900
You must not go.

834
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:15,120
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
" - You don't know that. "

835
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:20,790
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

836
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:23,670
But I can help them. I feel the Force.

837
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,960
But you cannot control it.

838
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,500
This is a dangerous time for you...

839
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:31,630
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

840
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,970
Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen.

841
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,260
The cave.

842
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:39,470
Remember your failure at the cave.

843
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,520
But I've learned so much since then.

844
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,310
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

845
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:46,400
You have my word.

846
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,320
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

847
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,150
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

848
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,280
That's why I have to go.

849
01:23:56,370 --> 01:24:00,740
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

850
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:02,410
You won't.

851
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,830
Stopped they must be. On this all depends.

852
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:11,170
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

853
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,880
will conquer Vader and his emperor.

854
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:16,090
If you end your training now...

855
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:20,510
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

856
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,270
you will become an agent of evil.

857
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,350
Patience.

858
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:29,690
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honor what they fight for...

859
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:30,820
yes.

860
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,030
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

861
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,160
I cannot interfere.

862
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,490
I understand.

863
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:47,790
R2, fire up the converters.

864
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:55,090
Don't give in to hate.

865
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:57,970
That leads to the dark side.

866
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,800
Strong is Vader.

867
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:02,470
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

868
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:04,890
I will.

869
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,480
And I'll return. I promise.

870
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:17,610
Told you, I did. Reckless is he.

871
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,320
Now...

872
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,200
matters are worse.

873
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,370
" That boy is our last hope. "

874
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:26,410
No, there is another.

875
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:01,870
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

876
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,030
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.

877
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,200
No one has seen or knows anything
about 3PO.

878
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:08,540
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

879
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,370
Relax.

880
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,380
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

881
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,960
I don't trust Lando.

882
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:19,420
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

883
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:22,220
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

884
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,720
Then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

885
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,260
What happened?

886
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,210
Where?

887
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:08,180
Found him in a junk pile?

888
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:10,850
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

889
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:16,520
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

890
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,990
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?

891
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,030
Not really.

892
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,580
You look absolutely beautiful.

893
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:31,000
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

894
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,580
Thank you.

895
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:35,630
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

896
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:38,550
Everyone's invited, of course.

897
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:40,760
Having trouble with your droid?

898
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,510
No. No problem. Why?

899
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,850
You see, since we're a small operation...

900
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:58,230
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

901
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,900
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

902
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:03,200
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

903
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,360
Which is advantageous for everybody...

904
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:09,910
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

905
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:13,910
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

906
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,330
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

907
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:20,170
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

908
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:23,590
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

909
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:36,100
We would be honored if you would join us.

910
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,400
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

911
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,030
I'm sorry.

912
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:52,870
I'm sorry too.

913
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:09,090
No, 3PO's with them.

914
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:12,600
Just hang on. We're almost there.

915
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:14,580
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

916
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,660
No, please don't get up.

917
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:25,880
Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger.

918
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,590
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

919
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,040
Lord Vader.

920
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,540
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

921
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,670
after I have Skywalker.

922
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,670
He's no good to me dead.

923
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:08,090
He will not be permanently damaged.

924
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:13,050
Lord Vader,
what about Leia and the Wookiee?

925
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,890
They must never again leave this city.

926
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:19,220
That wasn't part of our agreement,
nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

927
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:23,270
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

928
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,020
No.

929
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:30,740
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

930
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,490
This deal is getting worse all the time.

931
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,080
Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that.

932
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,250
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

933
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,000
That's much better.

934
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:49,760
Wait. Wait.

935
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,920
Oh, my! What have you done?

936
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,590
I'm backwards!

937
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,590
You flea-bitten furball!

938
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,390
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

939
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:14,950
I feel terrible.

940
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:32,260
Why are they doing this?

941
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,430
They never even asked me any questions.

942
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:48,940
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

943
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:52,150
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

944
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:54,150
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

945
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,410
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

946
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:58,950
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

947
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:02,450
He's after somebody called Skywalker.

948
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:05,120
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

949
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:07,120
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

950
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,250
You fixed us all real good, didn't you?

951
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:11,550
My friend.

952
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,050
Stop!

953
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:19,220
I've done all I can.

954
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,760
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

955
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,180
Yeah.

956
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:25,180
You're a real hero.

957
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,410
You certainly have a way with people.

958
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,630
This facility is crude...

959
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:57,840
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

960
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:00,220
for his journey to the emperor.

961
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:03,350
Lord Vader, ship approaching,
X-wing class.

962
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:06,850
Good.
Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.

963
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:13,110
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

964
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:16,110
I do not want the emperor's prize damaged.

965
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:19,320
We will test it on Captain Solo.

966
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:47,310
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

967
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:50,100
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

968
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:51,940
so don't do anything foolish.

969
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:08,120
What's going on, buddy?

970
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:11,120
You're being put into carbon freeze.

971
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:14,750
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

972
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,300
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

973
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:23,390
Chewbacca, stop!

974
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:25,510
No, Chewie, stop!

975
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,640
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

976
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,730
Hey! Hey! Listen to me.

977
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:33,350
Chewie, this won't help me.

978
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,110
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

979
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,570
The princess.

980
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:41,490
You have to take care of her.

981
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,700
Do you hear me?

982
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:02,550
- I love you.
- I know.

983
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:35,370
What's going on? Turn round. I can't see.

984
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,270
They've encased him in carbonite.

985
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,270
He should be quite well-protected...

986
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:40,310
if he survived the freezing process,
that is.

987
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,940
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

988
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:44,690
Yes, he's alive.

989
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:47,450
And in perfect hibernation.

990
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,570
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

991
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:53,120
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

992
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,370
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

993
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:01,420
Good.
See to it that he finds his way in here.

994
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:07,510
Calrissian...

995
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,050
take the princess and the Wookiee
to my ship.

996
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:12,300
You said they'd be left
under my supervision.

997
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:17,310
I am altering the deal.
Pray I don't alter it any further.

998
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,120
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

999
01:39:58,580 --> 01:39:59,750
It's a trap!

1000
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,500
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

1001
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,970
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1002
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:56,610
Well done.

1003
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,200
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1004
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,040
Move.

1005
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:10,750
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1006
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:12,630
I knew all along. It had to be a mistake.

1007
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:15,590
Do you think that
after what you did to Han...

1008
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:19,890
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1009
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:23,010
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1010
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,680
I'm just trying to help.

1011
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:27,430
We don't need any of your help.

1012
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,070
What?

1013
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:38,780
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1014
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:43,030
at the east... platform.

1015
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,330
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1016
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:51,250
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1017
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:54,840
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

1018
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,310
R2, where have you been?

1019
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,310
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1020
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:18,280
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1021
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:23,450
Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1022
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:25,950
Look what's happened to me.

1023
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,470
Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

1024
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,770
You have learned much, young one.

1025
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:57,980
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1026
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:12,710
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1027
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:16,040
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1028
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,510
All too easy.

1029
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,190
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1030
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:38,020
Impressive.

1031
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,360
Most impressive.

1032
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:52,910
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1033
01:44:55,670 --> 01:44:58,920
Now, release your anger.

1034
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,670
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1035
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:14,510
The security code has been changed.

1036
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,980
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1037
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,600
R2, hurry.

1038
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:26,190
Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.

1039
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,280
" The Empire has taken control
of the city. "

1040
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:31,240
" I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive. "

1041
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:39,370
This way.

1042
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:41,710
Well, don't blame me. I'm an interpreter.

1043
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:44,710
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1044
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:09,230
We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Falcon. It's fixed!

1045
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:17,080
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

1046
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:28,090
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

1047
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:55,280
That hurts!
Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

1048
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,790
Go!

1049
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:13,010
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1050
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:15,010
Of course I've looked better.

1051
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:12,360
You are beaten. It is useless to resist.

1052
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:15,990
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1053
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,420
There is no escape.

1054
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:36,420
Don't make me destroy you.

1055
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:43,180
You do not yet realize your importance.

1056
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,970
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1057
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:47,940
Join me...

1058
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:50,440
and I will complete your training.

1059
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,940
With our combined strength...

1060
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:55,980
we can end this destructive conflict...

1061
01:50:56,070 --> 01:50:58,400
and bring order to the galaxy.

1062
01:50:58,490 --> 01:51:01,030
I'll never join you!

1063
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:05,240
If you only knew
the power of the dark side.

1064
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:09,580
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1065
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:11,130
He told me enough.

1066
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:15,590
He told me you killed him.

1067
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,470
I am your father.

1068
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:29,940
That's not true.

1069
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:32,440
That's impossible!

1070
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:35,820
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1071
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:48,790
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1072
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:51,790
It is your destiny.

1073
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:53,630
Join me...

1074
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:58,090
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1075
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:10,310
Come with me.

1076
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:13,350
It is the only way.

1077
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:21,000
Ben.

1078
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,720
Ben, please.

1079
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:53,250
Hear me.

1080
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:02,250
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1081
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,760
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1082
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:08,090
Chewie, just do it.

1083
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:09,930
All right, all right!

1084
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:22,230
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1085
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,790
Look, someone's up there.

1086
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,500
It's Luke. Chewie, slow down.

1087
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:41,920
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1088
01:54:57,810 --> 01:55:00,190
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1089
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:24,130
- Lando?
" - Okay, let's go. "

1090
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:45,570
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1091
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,980
I'll be back.

1092
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:30,110
Stardestroyer.

1093
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,830
All right, Chewie. Ready for light speed.

1094
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:40,000
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1095
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,460
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1096
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:44,040
Punch it!

1097
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:57,010
They told me they fixed it.

1098
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,010
I trusted them!

1099
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:01,640
It's not my fault!

1100
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:09,900
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1101
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:13,570
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?

1102
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:15,700
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1103
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:19,450
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1104
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:22,620
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1105
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:27,460
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1106
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:29,170
We can't?

1107
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:31,670
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1108
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:37,850
The city's central computer told you?

1109
01:57:37,930 --> 01:57:40,720
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1110
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:44,140
Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing.

1111
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:57,610
Father.

1112
01:57:59,450 --> 01:58:01,620
Son, come with me.

1113
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,080
Ben.

1114
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:09,250
Why didn't you tell me?

1115
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:28,690
It's Vader.

1116
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:38,110
Luke, it is your destiny.

1117
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:48,080
Why didn't you tell me?

1118
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:58,340
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1119
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:04,520
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1120
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:08,140
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1121
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:12,730
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1122
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:17,360
You did it!

1123
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,090
- Luke, we're ready for takeoff.
" - Good luck, Lando. "

1124
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:23,050
" When we find Jabba the Hutt and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact you. "

1125
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:25,800
I'll meet you at the rendez-vous point
on Tatooine.

1126
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:29,350
Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.

1127
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:31,690
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.

1128
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:33,520
Take care, you two.

1129
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:35,690
" May the Force be with you. "
